      PART I
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Towards the end of November, during a thaw, at nine o&rsquo;clock one morning, a
      train on the Warsaw and Petersburg railway was approaching the latter city
      at full speed. The morning was so damp and misty that it was only with
      great difficulty that the day succeeded in breaking; and it was impossible
      to distinguish anything more than a few yards away from the carriage
      windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the passengers by this particular train were returning from
      abroad; but the third-class carriages were the best filled, chiefly with
      insignificant persons of various occupations and degrees, picked up at the
      different stations nearer town. All of them seemed weary, and most of them
      had sleepy eyes and a shivering expression, while their complexions
      generally appeared to have taken on the colour of the fog outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      When day dawned, two passengers in one of the third-class carriages found
      themselves opposite each other. Both were young fellows, both were rather
      poorly dressed, both had remarkable faces, and both were evidently anxious
      to start a conversation. If they had but known why, at this particular
      moment, they were both remarkable persons, they would undoubtedly have
      wondered at the strange chance which had set them down opposite to one
      another in a third-class carriage of the Warsaw Railway Company.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of them was a young fellow of about twenty-seven, not tall, with black
      curling hair, and small, grey, fiery eyes. His nose was broad and flat,
      and he had high cheek bones; his thin lips were constantly compressed into
      an impudent, ironical&mdash;it might almost be called a malicious&mdash;smile;
      but his forehead was high and well formed, and atoned for a good deal of
      the ugliness of the lower part of his face. A special feature of this
      physiognomy was its death-like pallor, which gave to the whole man an
      indescribably emaciated appearance in spite of his hard look, and at the
      same time a sort of passionate and suffering expression which did not
      harmonize with his impudent, sarcastic smile and keen, self-satisfied
      bearing. He wore a large fur&mdash;or rather astrachan&mdash;overcoat,
      which had kept him warm all night, while his neighbour had been obliged to
      bear the full severity of a Russian November night entirely unprepared.
      His wide sleeveless mantle with a large cape to it&mdash;the sort of cloak
      one sees upon travellers during the winter months in Switzerland or North
      Italy&mdash;was by no means adapted to the long cold journey through
      Russia, from Eydkuhnen to St. Petersburg.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wearer of this cloak was a young fellow, also of about twenty-six or
      twenty-seven years of age, slightly above the middle height, very fair,
      with a thin, pointed and very light coloured beard; his eyes were large
      and blue, and had an intent look about them, yet that heavy expression
      which some people affirm to be a peculiarity as well as evidence, of an
      epileptic subject. His face was decidedly a pleasant one for all that;
      refined, but quite colourless, except for the circumstance that at this
      moment it was blue with cold. He held a bundle made up of an old faded
      silk handkerchief that apparently contained all his travelling wardrobe,
      and wore thick shoes and gaiters, his whole appearance being very
      un-Russian.
    </p>
    <p>
      His black-haired neighbour inspected these peculiarities, having nothing
      better to do, and at length remarked, with that rude enjoyment of the
      discomforts of others which the common classes so often show:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cold?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very,&rdquo; said his neighbour, readily, &ldquo;and this is a thaw, too. Fancy if it
      had been a hard frost! I never thought it would be so cold in the old
      country. I&rsquo;ve grown quite out of the way of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, been abroad, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, straight from Switzerland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wheugh! my goodness!&rdquo; The black-haired young fellow whistled, and then
      laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation proceeded. The readiness of the fair-haired young man in
      the cloak to answer all his opposite neighbour&rsquo;s questions was surprising.
      He seemed to have no suspicion of any impertinence or inappropriateness in
      the fact of such questions being put to him. Replying to them, he made
      known to the inquirer that he certainly had been long absent from Russia,
      more than four years; that he had been sent abroad for his health; that he
      had suffered from some strange nervous malady&mdash;a kind of epilepsy,
      with convulsive spasms. His interlocutor burst out laughing several times
      at his answers; and more than ever, when to the question, &ldquo;whether he had
      been cured?&rdquo; the patient replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, they did not cure me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey! that&rsquo;s it! You stumped up your money for nothing, and we believe in
      those fellows, here!&rdquo; remarked the black-haired individual, sarcastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gospel truth, sir, Gospel truth!&rdquo; exclaimed another passenger, a shabbily
      dressed man of about forty, who looked like a clerk, and possessed a red
      nose and a very blotchy face. &ldquo;Gospel truth! All they do is to get hold of
      our good Russian money free, gratis, and for nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but you&rsquo;re quite wrong in my particular instance,&rdquo; said the Swiss
      patient, quietly. &ldquo;Of course I can&rsquo;t argue the matter, because I know only
      my own case; but my doctor gave me money&mdash;and he had very little&mdash;to
      pay my journey back, besides having kept me at his own expense, while
      there, for nearly two years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? Was there no one else to pay for you?&rdquo; asked the black-haired one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;Mr. Pavlicheff, who had been supporting me there, died a couple
      of years ago. I wrote to Mrs. General Epanchin at the time (she is a
      distant relative of mine), but she did not answer my letter. And so
      eventually I came back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where have you come to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is&mdash;where am I going to stay? I&mdash;I really don&rsquo;t quite know
      yet, I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both the listeners laughed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose your whole set-up is in that bundle, then?&rdquo; asked the first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bet anything it is!&rdquo; exclaimed the red-nosed passenger, with extreme
      satisfaction, &ldquo;and that he has precious little in the luggage van!&mdash;though
      of course poverty is no crime&mdash;we must remember that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It appeared that it was indeed as they had surmised. The young fellow
      hastened to admit the fact with wonderful readiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your bundle has some importance, however,&rdquo; continued the clerk, when they
      had laughed their fill (it was observable that the subject of their mirth
      joined in the laughter when he saw them laughing); &ldquo;for though I dare say
      it is not stuffed full of friedrichs d&rsquo;or and louis d&rsquo;or&mdash;judge from
      your costume and gaiters&mdash;still&mdash;if you can add to your
      possessions such a valuable property as a relation like Mrs. General
      Epanchin, then your bundle becomes a significant object at once. That is,
      of course, if you really are a relative of Mrs. Epanchin&rsquo;s, and have not
      made a little error through&mdash;well, absence of mind, which is very
      common to human beings; or, say&mdash;through a too luxuriant fancy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you are right again,&rdquo; said the fair-haired traveller, &ldquo;for I really
      am <i>almost</i> wrong when I say she and I are related. She is hardly a
      relation at all; so little, in fact, that I was not in the least surprised
      to have no answer to my letter. I expected as much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m! you spent your postage for nothing, then. H&rsquo;m! you are candid,
      however&mdash;and that is commendable. H&rsquo;m! Mrs. Epanchin&mdash;oh yes! a
      most eminent person. I know her. As for Mr. Pavlicheff, who supported you
      in Switzerland, I know him too&mdash;at least, if it was Nicolai
      Andreevitch of that name? A fine fellow he was&mdash;and had a property of
      four thousand souls in his day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Nicolai Andreevitch&mdash;that was his name,&rdquo; and the young fellow
      looked earnestly and with curiosity at the all-knowing gentleman with the
      red nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      This sort of character is met with pretty frequently in a certain class.
      They are people who know everyone&mdash;that is, they know where a man is
      employed, what his salary is, whom he knows, whom he married, what money
      his wife had, who are his cousins, and second cousins, etc., etc. These
      men generally have about a hundred pounds a year to live on, and they
      spend their whole time and talents in the amassing of this style of
      knowledge, which they reduce&mdash;or raise&mdash;to the standard of a
      science.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the latter part of the conversation the black-haired young man had
      become very impatient. He stared out of the window, and fidgeted, and
      evidently longed for the end of the journey. He was very absent; he would
      appear to listen&mdash;and heard nothing; and he would laugh of a sudden,
      evidently with no idea of what he was laughing about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; said the red-nosed man to the young fellow with the bundle,
      rather suddenly; &ldquo;whom have I the honour to be talking to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prince Lef Nicolaievitch Muishkin,&rdquo; replied the latter, with perfect
      readiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prince Muishkin? Lef Nicolaievitch? H&rsquo;m! I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sure! I may
      say I have never heard of such a person,&rdquo; said the clerk, thoughtfully.
      &ldquo;At least, the name, I admit, is historical. Karamsin must mention the
      family name, of course, in his history&mdash;but as an individual&mdash;one
      never hears of any Prince Muishkin nowadays.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; replied the prince; &ldquo;there are none, except myself. I
      believe I am the last and only one. As to my forefathers, they have always
      been a poor lot; my own father was a sublieutenant in the army. I don&rsquo;t
      know how Mrs. Epanchin comes into the Muishkin family, but she is
      descended from the Princess Muishkin, and she, too, is the last of her
      line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And did you learn science and all that, with your professor over there?&rdquo;
       asked the black-haired passenger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes&mdash;I did learn a little, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never learned anything whatever,&rdquo; said the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but I learned very little, you know!&rdquo; added the prince, as though
      excusing himself. &ldquo;They could not teach me very much on account of my
      illness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know the Rogojins?&rdquo; asked his questioner, abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t&mdash;not at all! I hardly know anyone in Russia. Why, is
      that your name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am Rogojin, Parfen Rogojin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Parfen Rogojin? dear me&mdash;then don&rsquo;t you belong to those very
      Rogojins, perhaps&mdash;&rdquo; began the clerk, with a very perceptible
      increase of civility in his tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;those very ones,&rdquo; interrupted Rogojin, impatiently, and with
      scant courtesy. I may remark that he had not once taken any notice of the
      blotchy-faced passenger, and had hitherto addressed all his remarks direct
      to the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me&mdash;is it possible?&rdquo; observed the clerk, while his face assumed
      an expression of great deference and servility&mdash;if not of absolute
      alarm: &ldquo;what, a son of that very Semen Rogojin&mdash;hereditary honourable
      citizen&mdash;who died a month or so ago and left two million and a half
      of roubles?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how do <i>you</i> know that he left two million and a half of
      roubles?&rdquo; asked Rogojin, disdainfully, and not deigning so much as to look
      at the other. &ldquo;However, it&rsquo;s true enough that my father died a month ago,
      and that here am I returning from Pskoff, a month after, with hardly a
      boot to my foot. They&rsquo;ve treated me like a dog! I&rsquo;ve been ill of fever at
      Pskoff the whole time, and not a line, nor farthing of money, have I
      received from my mother or my confounded brother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now you&rsquo;ll have a million roubles, at least&mdash;goodness gracious
      me!&rdquo; exclaimed the clerk, rubbing his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five weeks since, I was just like yourself,&rdquo; continued Rogojin,
      addressing the prince, &ldquo;with nothing but a bundle and the clothes I wore.
      I ran away from my father and came to Pskoff to my aunt&rsquo;s house, where I
      caved in at once with fever, and he went and died while I was away. All
      honour to my respected father&rsquo;s memory&mdash;but he uncommonly nearly
      killed me, all the same. Give you my word, prince, if I hadn&rsquo;t cut and run
      then, when I did, he&rsquo;d have murdered me like a dog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you angered him somehow?&rdquo; asked the prince, looking at the
      millionaire with considerable curiosity. But though there may have been
      something remarkable in the fact that this man was heir to millions of
      roubles there was something about him which surprised and interested the
      prince more than that. Rogojin, too, seemed to have taken up the
      conversation with unusual alacrity it appeared that he was still in a
      considerable state of excitement, if not absolutely feverish, and was in
      real need of someone to talk to for the mere sake of talking, as
      safety-valve to his agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for his red-nosed neighbour, the latter&mdash;since the information as
      to the identity of Rogojin&mdash;hung over him, seemed to be living on the
      honey of his words and in the breath of his nostrils, catching at every
      syllable as though it were a pearl of great price.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; I angered him&mdash;I certainly did anger him,&rdquo; replied Rogojin.
      &ldquo;But what puts me out so is my brother. Of course my mother couldn&rsquo;t do
      anything&mdash;she&rsquo;s too old&mdash;and whatever brother Senka says is law
      for her! But why couldn&rsquo;t he let me know? He sent a telegram, they say.
      What&rsquo;s the good of a telegram? It frightened my aunt so that she sent it
      back to the office unopened, and there it&rsquo;s been ever since! It&rsquo;s only
      thanks to Konief that I heard at all; he wrote me all about it. He says my
      brother cut off the gold tassels from my father&rsquo;s coffin, at night
      &lsquo;because they&rsquo;re worth a lot of money!&rsquo; says he. Why, I can get him sent
      off to Siberia for that alone, if I like; it&rsquo;s sacrilege. Here, you&mdash;scarecrow!&rdquo;
       he added, addressing the clerk at his side, &ldquo;is it sacrilege or not, by
      law?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sacrilege, certainly&mdash;certainly sacrilege,&rdquo; said the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s Siberia for sacrilege, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Undoubtedly so; Siberia, of course!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will think that I&rsquo;m still ill,&rdquo; continued Rogojin to the prince,
      &ldquo;but I sloped off quietly, seedy as I was, took the train and came away.
      Aha, brother Senka, you&rsquo;ll have to open your gates and let me in, my boy!
      I know he told tales about me to my father&mdash;I know that well enough
      but I certainly did rile my father about Nastasia Philipovna that&rsquo;s very
      sure, and that was my own doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nastasia Philipovna?&rdquo; said the clerk, as though trying to think out
      something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, you know nothing about <i>her</i>,&rdquo; said Rogojin, impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And supposing I do know something?&rdquo; observed the other, triumphantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bosh! there are plenty of Nastasia Philipovnas. And what an impertinent
      beast you are!&rdquo; he added angrily. &ldquo;I thought some creature like you would
      hang on to me as soon as I got hold of my money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but I do know, as it happens,&rdquo; said the clerk in an aggravating
      manner. &ldquo;Lebedeff knows all about her. You are pleased to reproach me,
      your excellency, but what if I prove that I am right after all? Nastasia
      Phillpovna&rsquo;s family name is Barashkoff&mdash;I know, you see&mdash;and she
      is a very well known lady, indeed, and comes of a good family, too. She is
      connected with one Totski, Afanasy Ivanovitch, a man of considerable
      property, a director of companies, and so on, and a great friend of
      General Epanchin, who is interested in the same matters as he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My eyes!&rdquo; said Rogojin, really surprised at last. &ldquo;The devil take the
      fellow, how does he know that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, he knows everything&mdash;Lebedeff knows everything! I was a month
      or two with Lihachof after his father died, your excellency, and while he
      was knocking about&mdash;he&rsquo;s in the debtor&rsquo;s prison now&mdash;I was with
      him, and he couldn&rsquo;t do a thing without Lebedeff; and I got to know
      Nastasia Philipovna and several people at that time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nastasia Philipovna? Why, you don&rsquo;t mean to say that she and Lihachof&mdash;&rdquo;
       cried Rogojin, turning quite pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, no, no, no! Nothing of the sort, I assure you!&rdquo; said Lebedeff,
      hastily. &ldquo;Oh dear no, not for the world! Totski&rsquo;s the only man with any
      chance there. Oh, no! He takes her to his box at the opera at the French
      theatre of an evening, and the officers and people all look at her and
      say, &lsquo;By Jove, there&rsquo;s the famous Nastasia Philipovna!&rsquo; but no one ever
      gets any further than that, for there is nothing more to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s quite true,&rdquo; said Rogojin, frowning gloomily; &ldquo;so Zaleshoff
      told me. I was walking about the Nefsky one fine day, prince, in my
      father&rsquo;s old coat, when she suddenly came out of a shop and stepped into
      her carriage. I swear I was all of a blaze at once. Then I met Zaleshoff&mdash;looking
      like a hair-dresser&rsquo;s assistant, got up as fine as I don&rsquo;t know who, while
      I looked like a tinker. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t flatter yourself, my boy,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;she&rsquo;s
      not for such as you; she&rsquo;s a princess, she is, and her name is Nastasia
      Philipovna Barashkoff, and she lives with Totski, who wishes to get rid of
      her because he&rsquo;s growing rather old&mdash;fifty-five or so&mdash;and wants
      to marry a certain beauty, the loveliest woman in all Petersburg.&rsquo; And
      then he told me that I could see Nastasia Philipovna at the opera-house
      that evening, if I liked, and described which was her box. Well, I&rsquo;d like
      to see my father allowing any of us to go to the theatre; he&rsquo;d sooner have
      killed us, any day. However, I went for an hour or so and saw Nastasia
      Philipovna, and I never slept a wink all night after. Next morning my
      father happened to give me two government loan bonds to sell, worth nearly
      five thousand roubles each. &lsquo;Sell them,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;and then take seven
      thousand five hundred roubles to the office, give them to the cashier, and
      bring me back the rest of the ten thousand, without looking in anywhere on
      the way; look sharp, I shall be waiting for you.&rsquo; Well, I sold the bonds,
      but I didn&rsquo;t take the seven thousand roubles to the office; I went
      straight to the English shop and chose a pair of earrings, with a diamond
      the size of a nut in each. They cost four hundred roubles more than I had,
      so I gave my name, and they trusted me. With the earrings I went at once
      to Zaleshoff&rsquo;s. &lsquo;Come on!&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;come on to Nastasia Philipovna&rsquo;s,&rsquo; and
      off we went without more ado. I tell you I hadn&rsquo;t a notion of what was
      about me or before me or below my feet all the way; I saw nothing
      whatever. We went straight into her drawing-room, and then she came out to
      us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say right out who I was, but Zaleshoff said: &lsquo;From Parfen
      Rogojin, in memory of his first meeting with you yesterday; be so kind as
      to accept these!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She opened the parcel, looked at the earrings, and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Thank your friend Mr. Rogojin for his kind attention,&rsquo; says she, and
      bowed and went off. Why didn&rsquo;t I die there on the spot? The worst of it
      all was, though, that the beast Zaleshoff got all the credit of it! I was
      short and abominably dressed, and stood and stared in her face and never
      said a word, because I was shy, like an ass! And there was he all in the
      fashion, pomaded and dressed out, with a smart tie on, bowing and
      scraping; and I bet anything she took him for me all the while!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Look here now,&rsquo; I said, when we came out, &lsquo;none of your interference
      here after this&mdash;do you understand?&rsquo; He laughed: &lsquo;And how are you going to
      settle up with your father?&rsquo; says he. I thought I might as well jump into
      the Neva at once without going home first; but it struck me that I
      wouldn&rsquo;t, after all, and I went home feeling like one of the damned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My goodness!&rdquo; shivered the clerk. &ldquo;And his father,&rdquo; he added, for the
      prince&rsquo;s instruction, &ldquo;and his father would have given a man a ticket to
      the other world for ten roubles any day&mdash;not to speak of ten
      thousand!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince observed Rogojin with great curiosity; he seemed paler than
      ever at this moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you know about it?&rdquo; cried the latter. &ldquo;Well, my father learned
      the whole story at once, and Zaleshoff blabbed it all over the town
      besides. So he took me upstairs and locked me up, and swore at me for an
      hour. &lsquo;This is only a foretaste,&rsquo; says he; &lsquo;wait a bit till night comes,
      and I&rsquo;ll come back and talk to you again.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what do you think? The old fellow went straight off to Nastasia
      Philipovna, touched the floor with his forehead, and began blubbering and
      beseeching her on his knees to give him back the diamonds. So after awhile
      she brought the box and flew out at him. &lsquo;There,&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;take your
      earrings, you wretched old miser; although they are ten times dearer than
      their value to me now that I know what it must have cost Parfen to get
      them! Give Parfen my compliments,&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;and thank him very much!&rsquo;
      Well, I meanwhile had borrowed twenty-five roubles from a friend, and off
      I went to Pskoff to my aunt&rsquo;s. The old woman there lectured me so that I
      left the house and went on a drinking tour round the public-houses of the
      place. I was in a high fever when I got to Pskoff, and by nightfall I was
      lying delirious in the streets somewhere or other!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oho! we&rsquo;ll make Nastasia Philipovna sing another song now!&rdquo; giggled
      Lebedeff, rubbing his hands with glee. &ldquo;Hey, my boy, we&rsquo;ll get her some
      proper earrings now! We&rsquo;ll get her such earrings that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; cried Rogojin, seizing him fiercely by the arm, &ldquo;look here,
      if you so much as name Nastasia Philipovna again, I&rsquo;ll tan your hide as
      sure as you sit there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aha! do&mdash;by all means! if you tan my hide you won&rsquo;t turn me away
      from your society. You&rsquo;ll bind me to you, with your lash, for ever. Ha,
      ha! here we are at the station, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sure enough, the train was just steaming in as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though Rogojin had declared that he left Pskoff secretly, a large
      collection of friends had assembled to greet him, and did so with profuse
      waving of hats and shouting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, there&rsquo;s Zaleshoff here, too!&rdquo; he muttered, gazing at the scene with
      a sort of triumphant but unpleasant smile. Then he suddenly turned to the
      prince: &ldquo;Prince, I don&rsquo;t know why I have taken a fancy to you; perhaps
      because I met you just when I did. But no, it can&rsquo;t be that, for I met
      this fellow&rdquo; (nodding at Lebedeff) &ldquo;too, and I have not taken a fancy to
      him by any means. Come to see me, prince; we&rsquo;ll take off those gaiters of
      yours and dress you up in a smart fur coat, the best we can buy. You shall
      have a dress coat, best quality, white waistcoat, anything you like, and
      your pocket shall be full of money. Come, and you shall go with me to
      Nastasia Philipovna&rsquo;s. Now then will you come or no?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Accept, accept, Prince Lef Nicolaievitch&rdquo; said Lebedef solemnly; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
      let it slip! Accept, quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Prince Muishkin rose and stretched out his hand courteously, while he
      replied with some cordiality:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will come with the greatest pleasure, and thank you very much for
      taking a fancy to me. I dare say I may even come today if I have time, for
      I tell you frankly that I like you very much too. I liked you especially
      when you told us about the diamond earrings; but I liked you before that
      as well, though you have such a dark-clouded sort of face. Thanks very
      much for the offer of clothes and a fur coat; I certainly shall require
      both clothes and coat very soon. As for money, I have hardly a copeck
      about me at this moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall have lots of money; by the evening I shall have plenty; so come
      along!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true enough, he&rsquo;ll have lots before evening!&rdquo; put in Lebedeff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, look here, are you a great hand with the ladies? Let&rsquo;s know that
      first?&rdquo; asked Rogojin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no, oh no!&rdquo; said the prince; &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t, you know&mdash;my illness&mdash;I
      hardly ever saw a soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m! well&mdash;here, you fellow&mdash;you can come along with me now if you
      like!&rdquo; cried Rogojin to Lebedeff, and so they all left the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lebedeff had his desire. He went off with the noisy group of Rogojin&rsquo;s
      friends towards the Voznesensky, while the prince&rsquo;s route lay towards the
      Litaynaya. It was damp and wet. The prince asked his way of passers-by,
      and finding that he was a couple of miles or so from his destination, he
      determined to take a droshky.
    </p>
    <h3>
      II.
    </h3>
    <p>
      General Epanchin lived in his own house near the Litaynaya. Besides this
      large residence&mdash;five-sixths of which was let in flats and
      lodgings&mdash;the general was owner of another enormous house in the Sadovaya
      bringing in even more rent than the first. Besides these houses he had a
      delightful little estate just out of town, and some sort of factory in
      another part of the city. General Epanchin, as everyone knew, had a good
      deal to do with certain government monopolies; he was also a voice, and an
      important one, in many rich public companies of various descriptions; in
      fact, he enjoyed the reputation of being a well-to-do man of busy habits,
      many ties, and affluent means. He had made himself indispensable in
      several quarters, amongst others in his department of the government; and
      yet it was a known fact that Fedor Ivanovitch Epanchin was a man of no
      education whatever, and had absolutely risen from the ranks.
    </p>
    <p>
      This last fact could, of course, reflect nothing but credit upon the
      general; and yet, though unquestionably a sagacious man, he had his own
      little weaknesses&mdash;very excusable ones,&mdash;one of which was a dislike to
      any allusion to the above circumstance. He was undoubtedly clever. For
      instance, he made a point of never asserting himself when he would gain
      more by keeping in the background; and in consequence many exalted
      personages valued him principally for his humility and simplicity, and
      because &ldquo;he knew his place.&rdquo; And yet if these good people could only have
      had a peep into the mind of this excellent fellow who &ldquo;knew his place&rdquo; so
      well! The fact is that, in spite of his knowledge of the world and his
      really remarkable abilities, he always liked to appear to be carrying out
      other people&rsquo;s ideas rather than his own. And also, his luck seldom failed
      him, even at cards, for which he had a passion that he did not attempt to
      conceal. He played for high stakes, and moved, altogether, in very varied
      society.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to age, General Epanchin was in the very prime of life; that is, about
      fifty-five years of age,&mdash;the flowering time of existence, when real
      enjoyment of life begins. His healthy appearance, good colour, sound,
      though discoloured teeth, sturdy figure, preoccupied air during business
      hours, and jolly good humour during his game at cards in the evening, all
      bore witness to his success in life, and combined to make existence a bed
      of roses to his excellency. The general was lord of a flourishing family,
      consisting of his wife and three grown-up daughters. He had married young,
      while still a lieutenant, his wife being a girl of about his own age, who
      possessed neither beauty nor education, and who brought him no more than
      fifty souls of landed property, which little estate served, however, as a
      nest-egg for far more important accumulations. The general never regretted
      his early marriage, or regarded it as a foolish youthful escapade; and he
      so respected and feared his wife that he was very near loving her. Mrs.
      Epanchin came of the princely stock of Muishkin, which if not a brilliant,
      was, at all events, a decidedly ancient family; and she was extremely
      proud of her descent.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a few exceptions, the worthy couple had lived through their long
      union very happily. While still young the wife had been able to make
      important friends among the aristocracy, partly by virtue of her family
      descent, and partly by her own exertions; while, in after life, thanks to
      their wealth and to the position of her husband in the service, she took
      her place among the higher circles as by right.
    </p>
    <p>
      During these last few years all three of the general&rsquo;s daughters&mdash;Alexandra,
      Adelaida, and Aglaya&mdash;had grown up and matured. Of course they were
      only Epanchins, but their mother&rsquo;s family was noble; they might expect
      considerable fortunes; their father had hopes of attaining to very high
      rank indeed in his country&rsquo;s service&mdash;all of which was satisfactory. All
      three of the girls were decidedly pretty, even the eldest, Alexandra, who
      was just twenty-five years old. The middle daughter was now twenty-three,
      while the youngest, Aglaya, was twenty. This youngest girl was absolutely
      a beauty, and had begun of late to attract considerable attention in
      society. But this was not all, for every one of the three was clever, well
      educated, and accomplished.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a matter of general knowledge that the three girls were very fond
      of one another, and supported each other in every way; it was even said
      that the two elder ones had made certain sacrifices for the sake of the
      idol of the household, Aglaya. In society they not only disliked asserting
      themselves, but were actually retiring. Certainly no one could blame them
      for being too arrogant or haughty, and yet everybody was well aware that
      they were proud and quite understood their own value. The eldest was
      musical, while the second was a clever artist, which fact she had
      concealed until lately. In a word, the world spoke well of the girls; but
      they were not without their enemies, and occasionally people talked with
      horror of the number of books they had read.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were in no hurry to marry. They liked good society, but were not too
      keen about it. All this was the more remarkable, because everyone was well
      aware of the hopes and aims of their parents.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was about eleven o&rsquo;clock in the forenoon when the prince rang the bell
      at General Epanchin&rsquo;s door. The general lived on the first floor or flat
      of the house, as modest a lodging as his position permitted. A liveried
      servant opened the door, and the prince was obliged to enter into long
      explanations with this gentleman, who, from the first glance, looked at
      him and his bundle with grave suspicion. At last, however, on the repeated
      positive assurance that he really was Prince Muishkin, and must absolutely
      see the general on business, the bewildered domestic showed him into a
      little ante-chamber leading to a waiting-room that adjoined the general&rsquo;s
      study, there handing him over to another servant, whose duty it was to be
      in this ante-chamber all the morning, and announce visitors to the
      general. This second individual wore a dress coat, and was some forty
      years of age; he was the general&rsquo;s special study servant, and well aware
      of his own importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait in the next room, please; and leave your bundle here,&rdquo; said the
      door-keeper, as he sat down comfortably in his own easy-chair in the
      ante-chamber. He looked at the prince in severe surprise as the latter
      settled himself in another chair alongside, with his bundle on his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind, I would rather sit here with you,&rdquo; said the prince; &ldquo;I
      should prefer it to sitting in there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but you can&rsquo;t stay here. You are a visitor&mdash;a guest, so to
      speak. Is it the general himself you wish to see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man evidently could not take in the idea of such a shabby-looking
      visitor, and had decided to ask once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I have business&mdash;&rdquo; began the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not ask you what your business may be, all I have to do is to
      announce you; and unless the secretary comes in here I cannot do that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man&rsquo;s suspicions seemed to increase more and more. The prince was too
      unlike the usual run of daily visitors; and although the general certainly
      did receive, on business, all sorts and conditions of men, yet in spite of
      this fact the servant felt great doubts on the subject of this particular
      visitor. The presence of the secretary as an intermediary was, he judged,
      essential in this case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely you&mdash;are from abroad?&rdquo; he inquired at last, in a confused
      sort of way. He had begun his sentence intending to say, &ldquo;Surely you are
      not Prince Muishkin, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, straight from the train! Did not you intend to say, &lsquo;Surely you are
      not Prince Muishkin?&rsquo; just now, but refrained out of politeness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; grunted the astonished servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you I am not deceiving you; you shall not have to answer for me.
      As to my being dressed like this, and carrying a bundle, there&rsquo;s nothing
      surprising in that&mdash;the fact is, my circumstances are not
      particularly rosy at this moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&mdash;no, I&rsquo;m not afraid of that, you see; I have to announce you,
      that&rsquo;s all. The secretary will be out directly&mdash;that is, unless you&mdash;yes,
      that&rsquo;s the rub&mdash;unless you&mdash;come, you must allow me to ask you&mdash;you&rsquo;ve
      not come to beg, have you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh dear no, you can be perfectly easy on that score. I have quite another
      matter on hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must excuse my asking, you know. Your appearance led me to think&mdash;but
      just wait for the secretary; the general is busy now, but the secretary is
      sure to come out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;well, look here, if I have some time to wait, would you mind
      telling me, is there any place about where I could have a smoke? I have my
      pipe and tobacco with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Smoke?</i>&rdquo; said the man, in shocked but disdainful surprise, blinking
      his eyes at the prince as though he could not believe his senses. &ldquo;No,
      sir, you cannot smoke here, and I wonder you are not ashamed of the very
      suggestion. Ha, ha! a cool idea that, I declare!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t mean in this room! I know I can&rsquo;t smoke here, of course. I&rsquo;d
      adjourn to some other room, wherever you like to show me to. You see, I&rsquo;m
      used to smoking a good deal, and now I haven&rsquo;t had a puff for three hours;
      however, just as you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now how on earth am I to announce a man like that?&rdquo; muttered the servant.
      &ldquo;In the first place, you&rsquo;ve no right in here at all; you ought to be in
      the waiting-room, because you&rsquo;re a sort of visitor&mdash;a guest, in fact&mdash;and
      I shall catch it for this. Look here, do you intend to take up you abode
      with us?&rdquo; he added, glancing once more at the prince&rsquo;s bundle, which
      evidently gave him no peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think so. I don&rsquo;t think I should stay even if they were to
      invite me. I&rsquo;ve simply come to make their acquaintance, and nothing more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make their acquaintance?&rdquo; asked the man, in amazement, and with redoubled
      suspicion. &ldquo;Then why did you say you had business with the general?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh well, very little business. There is one little matter&mdash;some
      advice I am going to ask him for; but my principal object is simply to
      introduce myself, because I am Prince Muishkin, and Madame Epanchin is the
      last of her branch of the house, and besides herself and me there are no
      other Muishkins left.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&mdash;you&rsquo;re a relation then, are you?&rdquo; asked the servant, so
      bewildered that he began to feel quite alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, hardly so. If you stretch a point, we are relations, of course, but
      so distant that one cannot really take cognizance of it. I once wrote to
      your mistress from abroad, but she did not reply. However, I have thought
      it right to make acquaintance with her on my arrival. I am telling you all
      this in order to ease your mind, for I see you are still far from
      comfortable on my account. All you have to do is to announce me as Prince
      Muishkin, and the object of my visit will be plain enough. If I am
      received&mdash;very good; if not, well, very good again. But they are sure
      to receive me, I should think; Madame Epanchin will naturally be curious
      to see the only remaining representative of her family. She values her
      Muishkin descent very highly, if I am rightly informed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince&rsquo;s conversation was artless and confiding to a degree, and the
      servant could not help feeling that as from visitor to common serving-man
      this state of things was highly improper. His conclusion was that one of
      two things must be the explanation&mdash;either that this was a begging
      impostor, or that the prince, if prince he were, was simply a fool,
      without the slightest ambition; for a sensible prince with any ambition
      would certainly not wait about in ante-rooms with servants, and talk of
      his own private affairs like this. In either case, how was he to announce
      this singular visitor?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really think I must request you to step into the next room!&rdquo; he said,
      with all the insistence he could muster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? If I had been sitting there now, I should not have had the
      opportunity of making these personal explanations. I see you are still
      uneasy about me and keep eyeing my cloak and bundle. Don&rsquo;t you think you
      might go in yourself now, without waiting for the secretary to come out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! I can&rsquo;t announce a visitor like yourself without the secretary.
      Besides the general said he was not to be disturbed&mdash;he is with the
      Colonel C&mdash;. Gavrila Ardalionovitch goes in without announcing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who may that be? a clerk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Gavrila Ardalionovitch? Oh no; he belongs to one of the companies.
      Look here, at all events put your bundle down, here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I will if I may; and&mdash;can I take off my cloak&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course; you can&rsquo;t go in <i>there</i> with it on, anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince rose and took off his mantle, revealing a neat enough morning
      costume&mdash;a little worn, but well made. He wore a steel watch chain
      and from this chain there hung a silver Geneva watch. Fool the prince
      might be, still, the general&rsquo;s servant felt that it was not correct for
      him to continue to converse thus with a visitor, in spite of the fact that
      the prince pleased him somehow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what time of day does the lady receive?&rdquo; the latter asked, reseating
      himself in his old place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s not in <i>my</i> province! I believe she receives at any time;
      it depends upon the visitors. The dressmaker goes in at eleven. Gavrila
      Ardalionovitch is allowed much earlier than other people, too; he is even
      admitted to early lunch now and then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is much warmer in the rooms here than it is abroad at this season,&rdquo;
       observed the prince; &ldquo;but it is much warmer there out of doors. As for the
      houses&mdash;a Russian can&rsquo;t live in them in the winter until he gets
      accustomed to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t they heat them at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they do heat them a little; but the houses and stoves are so
      different to ours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m! were you long away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four years! and I was in the same place nearly all the time,&mdash;in one
      village.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have forgotten Russia, hadn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed I had&mdash;a good deal; and, would you believe it, I often
      wonder at myself for not having forgotten how to speak Russian? Even now,
      as I talk to you, I keep saying to myself &lsquo;how well I am speaking it.&rsquo;
      Perhaps that is partly why I am so talkative this morning. I assure you,
      ever since yesterday evening I have had the strongest desire to go on and
      on talking Russian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m! yes; did you live in Petersburg in former years?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This good flunkey, in spite of his conscientious scruples, really could
      not resist continuing such a very genteel and agreeable conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Petersburg? Oh no! hardly at all, and now they say so much is changed
      in the place that even those who did know it well are obliged to relearn
      what they knew. They talk a good deal about the new law courts, and
      changes there, don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m! yes, that&rsquo;s true enough. Well now, how is the law over there, do
      they administer it more justly than here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know about that! I&rsquo;ve heard much that is good about our legal
      administration, too. There is no capital punishment here for one thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there over there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I saw an execution in France&mdash;at Lyons. Schneider took me
      over with him to see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, did they hang the fellow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, they cut off people&rsquo;s heads in France.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did the fellow do?&mdash;yell?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no&mdash;it&rsquo;s the work of an instant. They put a man inside a frame
      and a sort of broad knife falls by machinery&mdash;they call the thing a
      guillotine&mdash;it falls with fearful force and weight&mdash;the head
      springs off so quickly that you can&rsquo;t wink your eye in between. But all
      the preparations are so dreadful. When they announce the sentence, you
      know, and prepare the criminal and tie his hands, and cart him off to the
      scaffold&mdash;that&rsquo;s the fearful part of the business. The people all
      crowd round&mdash;even women&mdash;though they don&rsquo;t at all approve of
      women looking on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not a thing for women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not&mdash;of course not!&mdash;bah! The criminal was a fine
      intelligent fearless man; Le Gros was his name; and I may tell you&mdash;believe
      it or not, as you like&mdash;that when that man stepped upon the scaffold
      he <i>cried</i>, he did indeed,&mdash;he was as white as a bit of paper.
      Isn&rsquo;t it a dreadful idea that he should have cried&mdash;cried! Whoever
      heard of a grown man crying from fear&mdash;not a child, but a man who
      never had cried before&mdash;a grown man of forty-five years. Imagine what
      must have been going on in that man&rsquo;s mind at such a moment; what dreadful
      convulsions his whole spirit must have endured; it is an outrage on the
      soul that&rsquo;s what it is. Because it is said &lsquo;thou shalt not kill,&rsquo; is he to
      be killed because he murdered some one else? No, it is not right, it&rsquo;s an
      impossible theory. I assure you, I saw the sight a month ago and it&rsquo;s
      dancing before my eyes to this moment. I dream of it, often.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince had grown animated as he spoke, and a tinge of colour suffused
      his pale face, though his way of talking was as quiet as ever. The servant
      followed his words with sympathetic interest. Clearly he was not at all
      anxious to bring the conversation to an end. Who knows? Perhaps he too was
      a man of imagination and with some capacity for thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, at all events it is a good thing that there&rsquo;s no pain when the poor
      fellow&rsquo;s head flies off,&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, though,&rdquo; cried the prince warmly, &ldquo;you made that remark now,
      and everyone says the same thing, and the machine is designed with the
      purpose of avoiding pain, this guillotine I mean; but a thought came into
      my head then: what if it be a bad plan after all? You may laugh at my
      idea, perhaps&mdash;but I could not help its occurring to me all the same.
      Now with the rack and tortures and so on&mdash;you suffer terrible pain of
      course; but then your torture is bodily pain only (although no doubt you
      have plenty of that) until you die. But <i>here</i> I should imagine the
      most terrible part of the whole punishment is, not the bodily pain at all&mdash;but
      the certain knowledge that in an hour,&mdash;then in ten minutes, then in
      half a minute, then now&mdash;this very <i>instant</i>&mdash;your soul
      must quit your body and that you will no longer be a man&mdash;and that
      this is certain, <i>certain!</i> That&rsquo;s the point&mdash;the certainty of
      it. Just that instant when you place your head on the block and hear the
      iron grate over your head&mdash;then&mdash;that quarter of a second is the
      most awful of all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is not my own fantastical opinion&mdash;many people have thought the
      same; but I feel it so deeply that I&rsquo;ll tell you what I think. I believe
      that to execute a man for murder is to punish him immeasurably more
      dreadfully than is equivalent to his crime. A murder by sentence is far
      more dreadful than a murder committed by a criminal. The man who is
      attacked by robbers at night, in a dark wood, or anywhere, undoubtedly
      hopes and hopes that he may yet escape until the very moment of his death.
      There are plenty of instances of a man running away, or imploring for
      mercy&mdash;at all events hoping on in some degree&mdash;even after his
      throat was cut. But in the case of an execution, that last hope&mdash;having
      which it is so immeasurably less dreadful to die,&mdash;is taken away from
      the wretch and <i>certainty</i> substituted in its place! There is his
      sentence, and with it that terrible certainty that he cannot possibly
      escape death&mdash;which, I consider, must be the most dreadful anguish in
      the world. You may place a soldier before a cannon&rsquo;s mouth in battle, and
      fire upon him&mdash;and he will still hope. But read to that same soldier
      his death-sentence, and he will either go mad or burst into tears. Who
      dares to say that any man can suffer this without going mad? No, no! it is
      an abuse, a shame, it is unnecessary&mdash;why should such a thing exist?
      Doubtless there may be men who have been sentenced, who have suffered this
      mental anguish for a while and then have been reprieved; perhaps such men
      may have been able to relate their feelings afterwards. Our Lord Christ
      spoke of this anguish and dread. No! no! no! No man should be treated so,
      no man, no man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The servant, though of course he could not have expressed all this as the
      prince did, still clearly entered into it and was greatly conciliated, as
      was evident from the increased amiability of his expression. &ldquo;If you are
      really very anxious for a smoke,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;I think it might possibly
      be managed, if you are very quick about it. You see they might come out
      and inquire for you, and you wouldn&rsquo;t be on the spot. You see that door
      there? Go in there and you&rsquo;ll find a little room on the right; you can
      smoke there, only open the window, because I ought not to allow it really,
      and&mdash;.&rdquo; But there was no time, after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      A young fellow entered the ante-room at this moment, with a bundle of
      papers in his hand. The footman hastened to help him take off his
      overcoat. The new arrival glanced at the prince out of the corners of his
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This gentleman declares, Gavrila Ardalionovitch,&rdquo; began the man,
      confidentially and almost familiarly, &ldquo;that he is Prince Muishkin and a
      relative of Madame Epanchin&rsquo;s. He has just arrived from abroad, with
      nothing but a bundle by way of luggage&mdash;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince did not hear the rest, because at this point the servant
      continued his communication in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gavrila Ardalionovitch listened attentively, and gazed at the prince with
      great curiosity. At last he motioned the man aside and stepped hurriedly
      towards the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you Prince Muishkin?&rdquo; he asked, with the greatest courtesy and
      amiability.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a remarkably handsome young fellow of some twenty-eight summers,
      fair and of middle height; he wore a small beard, and his face was most
      intelligent. Yet his smile, in spite of its sweetness, was a little thin,
      if I may so call it, and showed his teeth too evenly; his gaze though
      decidedly good-humoured and ingenuous, was a trifle too inquisitive and
      intent to be altogether agreeable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably when he is alone he looks quite different, and hardly smiles at
      all!&rdquo; thought the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      He explained about himself in a few words, very much the same as he had
      told the footman and Rogojin beforehand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gavrila Ardalionovitch meanwhile seemed to be trying to recall something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it not you, then, who sent a letter a year or less ago&mdash;from
      Switzerland, I think it was&mdash;to Elizabetha Prokofievna (Mrs.
      Epanchin)?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, then, of course they will remember who you are. You wish to see the
      general? I&rsquo;ll tell him at once&mdash;he will be free in a minute; but you&mdash;you
      had better wait in the ante-chamber,&mdash;hadn&rsquo;t you? Why is he here?&rdquo; he
      added, severely, to the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you, sir, he wished it himself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the study door opened, and a military man, with a portfolio
      under his arm, came out talking loudly, and after bidding good-bye to
      someone inside, took his departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You there, Gania?&rdquo; cried a voice from the study, &ldquo;come in here, will
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gavrila Ardalionovitch nodded to the prince and entered the room hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      A couple of minutes later the door opened again and the affable voice of
      Gania cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in please, prince!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <h3>
      III.
    </h3>
    <p>
      General Ivan Fedorovitch Epanchin was standing in the middle of the room,
      and gazed with great curiosity at the prince as he entered. He even
      advanced a couple of steps to meet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince came forward and introduced himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; replied the general, &ldquo;and what can I do for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I have no special business; my principal object was to make your
      acquaintance. I should not like to disturb you. I do not know your times
      and arrangements here, you see, but I have only just arrived. I came
      straight from the station. I am come direct from Switzerland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The general very nearly smiled, but thought better of it and kept his
      smile back. Then he reflected, blinked his eyes, stared at his guest once
      more from head to foot; then abruptly motioned him to a chair, sat down
      himself, and waited with some impatience for the prince to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gania stood at his table in the far corner of the room, turning over
      papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not much time for making acquaintances, as a rule,&rdquo; said the
      general, &ldquo;but as, of course, you have your object in coming, I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I felt sure you would think I had some object in view when I resolved to
      pay you this visit,&rdquo; the prince interrupted; &ldquo;but I give you my word,
      beyond the pleasure of making your acquaintance I had no personal object
      whatever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pleasure is, of course, mutual; but life is not all pleasure, as you
      are aware. There is such a thing as business, and I really do not see what
      possible reason there can be, or what we have in common to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there is no reason, of course, and I suppose there is nothing in
      common between us, or very little; for if I am Prince Muishkin, and your
      wife happens to be a member of my house, that can hardly be called a
      &lsquo;reason.&rsquo; I quite understand that. And yet that was my whole motive for
      coming. You see I have not been in Russia for four years, and knew very
      little about anything when I left. I had been very ill for a long time,
      and I feel now the need of a few good friends. In fact, I have a certain
      question upon which I much need advice, and do not know whom to go to for
      it. I thought of your family when I was passing through Berlin. &lsquo;They are
      almost relations,&rsquo; I said to myself, &lsquo;so I&rsquo;ll begin with them; perhaps we
      may get on with each other, I with them and they with me, if they are kind
      people;&rsquo; and I have heard that you are very kind people!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, thank you, thank you, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; replied the general, considerably
      taken aback. &ldquo;May I ask where you have taken up your quarters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nowhere, as yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, straight from the station to my house? And how about your luggage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only had a small bundle, containing linen, with me, nothing more. I can
      carry it in my hand, easily. There will be plenty of time to take a room
      in some hotel by the evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, then you <i>do</i> intend to take a room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To judge from your words, you came straight to my house with the
      intention of staying there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That could only have been on your invitation. I confess, however, that I
      should not have stayed here even if you had invited me, not for any
      particular reason, but because it is&mdash;well, contrary to my practice
      and nature, somehow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, indeed! Then it is perhaps as well that I neither <i>did</i> invite
      you, nor <i>do</i> invite you now. Excuse me, prince, but we had better
      make this matter clear, once for all. We have just agreed that with regard
      to our relationship there is not much to be said, though, of course, it
      would have been very delightful to us to feel that such relationship did
      actually exist; therefore, perhaps&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Therefore, perhaps I had better get up and go away?&rdquo; said the prince,
      laughing merrily as he rose from his place; just as merrily as though the
      circumstances were by no means strained or difficult. &ldquo;And I give you my
      word, general, that though I know nothing whatever of manners and customs
      of society, and how people live and all that, yet I felt quite sure that
      this visit of mine would end exactly as it has ended now. Oh, well, I
      suppose it&rsquo;s all right; especially as my letter was not answered. Well,
      good-bye, and forgive me for having disturbed you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince&rsquo;s expression was so good-natured at this moment, and so
      entirely free from even a suspicion of unpleasant feeling was the smile
      with which he looked at the general as he spoke, that the latter suddenly
      paused, and appeared to gaze at his guest from quite a new point of view,
      all in an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, prince,&rdquo; he said, in quite a different tone, &ldquo;I do not know
      you at all, yet, and after all, Elizabetha Prokofievna would very likely
      be pleased to have a peep at a man of her own name. Wait a little, if you
      don&rsquo;t mind, and if you have time to spare?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I assure you I&rsquo;ve lots of time, my time is entirely my own!&rdquo; And the
      prince immediately replaced his soft, round hat on the table. &ldquo;I confess,
      I thought Elizabetha Prokofievna would very likely remember that I had
      written her a letter. Just now your servant&mdash;outside there&mdash;was
      dreadfully suspicious that I had come to beg of you. I noticed that!
      Probably he has very strict instructions on that score; but I assure you I
      did not come to beg. I came to make some friends. But I am rather bothered
      at having disturbed you; that&rsquo;s all I care about.&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, prince,&rdquo; said the general, with a cordial smile, &ldquo;if you
      really are the sort of man you appear to be, it may be a source of great
      pleasure to us to make your better acquaintance; but, you see, I am a very
      busy man, and have to be perpetually sitting here and signing papers, or
      off to see his excellency, or to my department, or somewhere; so that
      though I should be glad to see more of people, nice people&mdash;you see,
      I&mdash;however, I am sure you are so well brought up that you will see at
      once, and&mdash;but how old are you, prince?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty-six.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No? I thought you very much younger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, they say I have a &lsquo;young&rsquo; face. As to disturbing you I shall soon
      learn to avoid doing that, for I hate disturbing people. Besides, you and
      I are so differently constituted, I should think, that there must be very
      little in common between us. Not that I will ever believe there is <i>nothing</i>
      in common between any two people, as some declare is the case. I am sure
      people make a great mistake in sorting each other into groups, by
      appearances; but I am boring you, I see, you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just two words: have you any means at all? Or perhaps you may be
      intending to undertake some sort of employment? Excuse my questioning you,
      but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my dear sir, I esteem and understand your kindness in putting the
      question. No; at present I have no means whatever, and no employment
      either, but I hope to find some. I was living on other people abroad.
      Schneider, the professor who treated me and taught me, too, in
      Switzerland, gave me just enough money for my journey, so that now I have
      but a few copecks left. There certainly is one question upon which I am
      anxious to have advice, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, how do you intend to live now, and what are your plans?&rdquo;
       interrupted the general.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to work, somehow or other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, but then, you see, you are a philosopher. Have you any talents,
      or ability in any direction&mdash;that is, any that would bring in money
      and bread? Excuse me again&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t apologize. No, I don&rsquo;t think I have either talents or special
      abilities of any kind; on the contrary. I have always been an invalid and
      unable to learn much. As for bread, I should think&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The general interrupted once more with questions; while the prince again
      replied with the narrative we have heard before. It appeared that the
      general had known Pavlicheff; but why the latter had taken an interest in
      the prince, that young gentleman could not explain; probably by virtue of
      the old friendship with his father, he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince had been left an orphan when quite a little child, and
      Pavlicheff had entrusted him to an old lady, a relative of his own, living
      in the country, the child needing the fresh air and exercise of country
      life. He was educated, first by a governess, and afterwards by a tutor,
      but could not remember much about this time of his life. His fits were so
      frequent then, that they made almost an idiot of him (the prince used the
      expression &ldquo;idiot&rdquo; himself). Pavlicheff had met Professor Schneider in
      Berlin, and the latter had persuaded him to send the boy to Switzerland,
      to Schneider&rsquo;s establishment there, for the cure of his epilepsy, and,
      five years before this time, the prince was sent off. But Pavlicheff had
      died two or three years since, and Schneider had himself supported the
      young fellow, from that day to this, at his own expense. Although he had
      not quite cured him, he had greatly improved his condition; and now, at
      last, at the prince&rsquo;s own desire, and because of a certain matter which
      came to the ears of the latter, Schneider had despatched the young man to
      Russia.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general was much astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you have no one, absolutely <i>no</i> one in Russia?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one, at present; but I hope to make friends; and then I have a letter
      from&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At all events,&rdquo; put in the general, not listening to the news about the
      letter, &ldquo;at all events, you must have learned <i>something</i>, and your
      malady would not prevent your undertaking some easy work, in one of the
      departments, for instance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh dear no, oh no! As for a situation, I should much like to find one for
      I am anxious to discover what I really am fit for. I have learned a good
      deal in the last four years, and, besides, I read a great many Russian
      books.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Russian books, indeed? Then, of course, you can read and write quite
      correctly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh dear, yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Capital! And your handwriting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, there I am <i>really</i> talented! I may say I am a real
      caligraphist. Let me write you something, just to show you,&rdquo; said the
      prince, with some excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With pleasure! In fact, it is very necessary. I like your readiness,
      prince; in fact, I must say&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;like you very well,
      altogether,&rdquo; said the general.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What delightful writing materials you have here, such a lot of pencils
      and things, and what beautiful paper! It&rsquo;s a charming room altogether. I
      know that picture, it&rsquo;s a Swiss view. I&rsquo;m sure the artist painted it from
      nature, and that I have seen the very place&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite likely, though I bought it here. Gania, give the prince some paper.
      Here are pens and paper; now then, take this table. What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; the
      general continued to Gania, who had that moment taken a large photograph
      out of his portfolio, and shown it to his senior. &ldquo;Halloa! Nastasia
      Philipovna! Did she send it you herself? Herself?&rdquo; he inquired, with much
      curiosity and great animation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She gave it me just now, when I called in to congratulate her. I asked
      her for it long ago. I don&rsquo;t know whether she meant it for a hint that I
      had come empty-handed, without a present for her birthday, or what,&rdquo; added
      Gania, with an unpleasant smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nonsense, nonsense,&rdquo; said the general, with decision. &ldquo;What
      extraordinary ideas you have, Gania! As if she would hint; that&rsquo;s not her
      way at all. Besides, what could <i>you</i> give her, without having
      thousands at your disposal? You might have given her your portrait,
      however. Has she ever asked you for it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not yet. Very likely she never will. I suppose you haven&rsquo;t forgotten
      about tonight, have you, Ivan Fedorovitch? You were one of those specially
      invited, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no, I remember all right, and I shall go, of course. I should think
      so! She&rsquo;s twenty-five years old today! And, you know, Gania, you must be
      ready for great things; she has promised both myself and Afanasy
      Ivanovitch that she will give a decided answer tonight, yes or no. So be
      prepared!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gania suddenly became so ill at ease that his face grew paler than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure she said that?&rdquo; he asked, and his voice seemed to quiver as
      he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she promised. We both worried her so that she gave in; but she
      wished us to tell you nothing about it until the day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The general watched Gania&rsquo;s confusion intently, and clearly did not like
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember, Ivan Fedorovitch,&rdquo; said Gania, in great agitation, &ldquo;that I was
      to be free too, until her decision; and that even then I was to have my
      &lsquo;yes or no&rsquo; free.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, don&rsquo;t you, aren&rsquo;t you&mdash;&rdquo; began the general, in alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t misunderstand&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear fellow, what are you doing, what do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not rejecting her. I may have expressed myself badly, but I
      didn&rsquo;t mean that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reject her! I should think not!&rdquo; said the general with annoyance, and
      apparently not in the least anxious to conceal it. &ldquo;Why, my dear fellow,
      it&rsquo;s not a question of your rejecting her, it is whether you are prepared
      to receive her consent joyfully, and with proper satisfaction. How are
      things going on at home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At home? Oh, I can do as I like there, of course; only my father will
      make a fool of himself, as usual. He is rapidly becoming a general
      nuisance. I don&rsquo;t ever talk to him now, but I hold him in check, safe
      enough. I swear if it had not been for my mother, I should have shown him
      the way out, long ago. My mother is always crying, of course, and my
      sister sulks. I had to tell them at last that I intended to be master of
      my own destiny, and that I expect to be obeyed at home. At least, I gave
      my sister to understand as much, and my mother was present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I must say, I cannot understand it!&rdquo; said the general, shrugging
      his shoulders and dropping his hands. &ldquo;You remember your mother, Nina
      Alexandrovna, that day she came and sat here and groaned&mdash;and when I
      asked her what was the matter, she says, &lsquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s such a <i>dishonour</i>
      to us!&rsquo; dishonour! Stuff and nonsense! I should like to know who can
      reproach Nastasia Philipovna, or who can say a word of any kind against
      her. Did she mean because Nastasia had been living with Totski? What
      nonsense it is! You would not let her come near your daughters, says Nina
      Alexandrovna. What next, I wonder? I don&rsquo;t see how she can fail to&mdash;to
      understand&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her own position?&rdquo; prompted Gania. &ldquo;She does understand. Don&rsquo;t be annoyed
      with her. I have warned her not to meddle in other people&rsquo;s affairs.
      However, although there&rsquo;s comparative peace at home at present, the storm
      will break if anything is finally settled tonight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince heard the whole of the foregoing conversation, as he sat at the
      table, writing. He finished at last, and brought the result of his labour
      to the general&rsquo;s desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So this is Nastasia Philipovna,&rdquo; he said, looking attentively and
      curiously at the portrait. &ldquo;How wonderfully beautiful!&rdquo; he immediately
      added, with warmth. The picture was certainly that of an unusually lovely
      woman. She was photographed in a black silk dress of simple design, her
      hair was evidently dark and plainly arranged, her eyes were deep and
      thoughtful, the expression of her face passionate, but proud. She was
      rather thin, perhaps, and a little pale. Both Gania and the general gazed
      at the prince in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know it&rsquo;s Nastasia Philipovna?&rdquo; asked the general; &ldquo;you surely
      don&rsquo;t know her already, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do! I have only been one day in Russia, but I have heard of the
      great beauty!&rdquo; And the prince proceeded to narrate his meeting with
      Rogojin in the train and the whole of the latter&rsquo;s story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s news!&rdquo; said the general in some excitement, after listening to
      the story with engrossed attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, of course it&rsquo;s nothing but humbug!&rdquo; cried Gania, a little disturbed,
      however. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all humbug; the young merchant was pleased to indulge in a
      little innocent recreation! I have heard something of Rogojin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, so have I!&rdquo; replied the general. &ldquo;Nastasia Philipovna told us all
      about the earrings that very day. But now it is quite a different matter.
      You see the fellow really has a million of roubles, and he is passionately
      in love. The whole story smells of passion, and we all know what this
      class of gentry is capable of when infatuated. I am much afraid of some
      disagreeable scandal, I am indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are afraid of the million, I suppose,&rdquo; said Gania, grinning and
      showing his teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you are <i>not</i>, I presume, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did he strike you, prince?&rdquo; asked Gania, suddenly. &ldquo;Did he seem to be
      a serious sort of a man, or just a common rowdy fellow? What was your own
      opinion about the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While Gania put this question, a new idea suddenly flashed into his brain,
      and blazed out, impatiently, in his eyes. The general, who was really
      agitated and disturbed, looked at the prince too, but did not seem to
      expect much from his reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t quite know how to tell you,&rdquo; replied the prince, &ldquo;but it
      certainly did seem to me that the man was full of passion, and not,
      perhaps, quite healthy passion. He seemed to be still far from well. Very
      likely he will be in bed again in a day or two, especially if he lives
      fast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! do you think so?&rdquo; said the general, catching at the idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do think so!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but the sort of scandal I referred to may happen at any moment. It
      may be this very evening,&rdquo; remarked Gania to the general, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course; quite so. In that case it all depends upon what is going on in
      her brain at this moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know the kind of person she is at times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How? What kind of person is she?&rdquo; cried the general, arrived at the
      limits of his patience. &ldquo;Look here, Gania, don&rsquo;t you go annoying her
      tonight. What you are to do is to be as agreeable towards her as ever you
      can. Well, what are you smiling at? You must understand, Gania, that I
      have no interest whatever in speaking like this. Whichever way the
      question is settled, it will be to my advantage. Nothing will move Totski
      from his resolution, so I run no risk. If there is anything I desire, you
      must know that it is your benefit only. Can&rsquo;t you trust me? You are a
      sensible fellow, and I have been counting on you; for, in this matter,
      that, that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s the chief thing,&rdquo; said Gania, helping the general out of his
      difficulties again, and curling his lips in an envenomed smile, which he
      did not attempt to conceal. He gazed with his fevered eyes straight into
      those of the general, as though he were anxious that the latter might read
      his thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general grew purple with anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of course it is the chief thing!&rdquo; he cried, looking sharply at
      Gania. &ldquo;What a very curious man you are, Gania! You actually seem to be <i>glad</i>
      to hear of this millionaire fellow&rsquo;s arrival&mdash;just as though you
      wished for an excuse to get out of the whole thing. This is an affair in
      which you ought to act honestly with both sides, and give due warning, to
      avoid compromising others. But, even now, there is still time. Do you
      understand me? I wish to know whether you desire this arrangement or
      whether you do not? If not, say so,&mdash;and&mdash;and welcome! No one is
      trying to force you into the snare, Gavrila Ardalionovitch, if you see a
      snare in the matter, at least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do desire it,&rdquo; murmured Gania, softly but firmly, lowering his eyes;
      and he relapsed into gloomy silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general was satisfied. He had excited himself, and was evidently now
      regretting that he had gone so far. He turned to the prince, and suddenly
      the disagreeable thought of the latter&rsquo;s presence struck him, and the
      certainty that he must have heard every word of the conversation. But he
      felt at ease in another moment; it only needed one glance at the prince to
      see that in that quarter there was nothing to fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried the general, catching sight of the prince&rsquo;s specimen of
      caligraphy, which the latter had now handed him for inspection. &ldquo;Why, this
      is simply beautiful; look at that, Gania, there&rsquo;s real talent there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On a sheet of thick writing-paper the prince had written in medieval
      characters the legend:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The gentle Abbot Pafnute signed this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; explained the prince, with great delight and animation, &ldquo;there,
      that&rsquo;s the abbot&rsquo;s real signature&mdash;from a manuscript of the
      fourteenth century. All these old abbots and bishops used to write most
      beautifully, with such taste and so much care and diligence. Have you no
      copy of Pogodin, general? If you had one I could show you another type.
      Stop a bit&mdash;here you have the large round writing common in France
      during the eighteenth century. Some of the letters are shaped quite
      differently from those now in use. It was the writing current then, and
      employed by public writers generally. I copied this from one of them, and
      you can see how good it is. Look at the well-rounded a and d. I have tried
      to translate the French character into the Russian letters&mdash;a
      difficult thing to do, but I think I have succeeded fairly. Here is a fine
      sentence, written in a good, original hand&mdash;&lsquo;Zeal triumphs over all.&rsquo;
      That is the script of the Russian War Office. That is how official
      documents addressed to important personages should be written. The letters
      are round, the type black, and the style somewhat remarkable. A stylist
      would not allow these ornaments, or attempts at flourishes&mdash;just look
      at these unfinished tails!&mdash;but it has distinction and really depicts
      the soul of the writer. He would like to give play to his imagination, and
      follow the inspiration of his genius, but a soldier is only at ease in the
      guard-room, and the pen stops half-way, a slave to discipline. How
      delightful! The first time I met an example of this handwriting, I was
      positively astonished, and where do you think I chanced to find it? In
      Switzerland, of all places! Now that is an ordinary English hand. It can
      hardly be improved, it is so refined and exquisite&mdash;almost
      perfection. This is an example of another kind, a mixture of styles. The
      copy was given me by a French commercial traveller. It is founded on the
      English, but the downstrokes are a little blacker, and more marked. Notice
      that the oval has some slight modification&mdash;it is more rounded. This
      writing allows for flourishes; now a flourish is a dangerous thing! Its
      use requires such taste, but, if successful, what a distinction it gives
      to the whole! It results in an incomparable type&mdash;one to fall in love
      with!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me! How you have gone into all the refinements and details of the
      question! Why, my dear fellow, you are not a caligraphist, you are an
      artist! Eh, Gania?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo; said Gania. &ldquo;And he knows it too,&rdquo; he added, with a sarcastic
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may smile,&mdash;but there&rsquo;s a career in this,&rdquo; said the general.
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what a great personage I shall show this to, prince. Why,
      you can command a situation at thirty-five roubles per month to start
      with. However, it&rsquo;s half-past twelve,&rdquo; he concluded, looking at his watch;
      &ldquo;so to business, prince, for I must be setting to work and shall not see
      you again today. Sit down a minute. I have told you that I cannot receive
      you myself very often, but I should like to be of some assistance to you,
      some small assistance, of a kind that would give you satisfaction. I shall
      find you a place in one of the State departments, an easy place&mdash;but
      you will require to be accurate. Now, as to your plans&mdash;in the house,
      or rather in the family of Gania here&mdash;my young friend, whom I hope
      you will know better&mdash;his mother and sister have prepared two or
      three rooms for lodgers, and let them to highly recommended young fellows,
      with board and attendance. I am sure Nina Alexandrovna will take you in on
      my recommendation. There you will be comfortable and well taken care of;
      for I do not think, prince, that you are the sort of man to be left to the
      mercy of Fate in a town like Petersburg. Nina Alexandrovna, Gania&rsquo;s
      mother, and Varvara Alexandrovna, are ladies for whom I have the highest
      possible esteem and respect. Nina Alexandrovna is the wife of General
      Ardalion Alexandrovitch, my old brother in arms, with whom, I regret to
      say, on account of certain circumstances, I am no longer acquainted. I
      give you all this information, prince, in order to make it clear to you
      that I am personally recommending you to this family, and that in so
      doing, I am more or less taking upon myself to answer for you. The terms
      are most reasonable, and I trust that your salary will very shortly prove
      amply sufficient for your expenditure. Of course pocket-money is a
      necessity, if only a little; do not be angry, prince, if I strongly
      recommend you to avoid carrying money in your pocket. But as your purse is
      quite empty at the present moment, you must allow me to press these
      twenty-five roubles upon your acceptance, as something to begin with. Of
      course we will settle this little matter another time, and if you are the
      upright, honest man you look, I anticipate very little trouble between us
      on that score. Taking so much interest in you as you may perceive I do, I
      am not without my object, and you shall know it in good time. You see, I
      am perfectly candid with you. I hope, Gania, you have nothing to say
      against the prince&rsquo;s taking up his abode in your house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, on the contrary! my mother will be very glad,&rdquo; said Gania,
      courteously and kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think only one of your rooms is engaged as yet, is it not? That fellow
      Ferd-Ferd&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ferdishenko.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I don&rsquo;t like that Ferdishenko. I can&rsquo;t understand why Nastasia
      Philipovna encourages him so. Is he really her cousin, as he says?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh dear no, it&rsquo;s all a joke. No more cousin than I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what do you think of the arrangement, prince?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, general; you have behaved very kindly to me; all the more so
      since I did not ask you to help me. I don&rsquo;t say that out of pride. I
      certainly did not know where to lay my head tonight. Rogojin asked me to
      come to his house, of course, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rogojin? No, no, my good fellow. I should strongly recommend you,
      paternally,&mdash;or, if you prefer it, as a friend,&mdash;to forget all
      about Rogojin, and, in fact, to stick to the family into which you are
      about to enter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; began the prince; &ldquo;and since you are so very kind there is
      just one matter which I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must really excuse me,&rdquo; interrupted the general, &ldquo;but I positively
      haven&rsquo;t another moment now. I shall just tell Elizabetha Prokofievna about
      you, and if she wishes to receive you at once&mdash;as I shall advise her&mdash;I
      strongly recommend you to ingratiate yourself with her at the first
      opportunity, for my wife may be of the greatest service to you in many
      ways. If she cannot receive you now, you must be content to wait till
      another time. Meanwhile you, Gania, just look over these accounts, will
      you? We mustn&rsquo;t forget to finish off that matter&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The general left the room, and the prince never succeeded in broaching the
      business which he had on hand, though he had endeavoured to do so four
      times.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gania lit a cigarette and offered one to the prince. The latter accepted
      the offer, but did not talk, being unwilling to disturb Gania&rsquo;s work. He
      commenced to examine the study and its contents. But Gania hardly so much
      as glanced at the papers lying before him; he was absent and thoughtful,
      and his smile and general appearance struck the prince still more
      disagreeably now that the two were left alone together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Gania approached our hero who was at the moment standing over
      Nastasia Philipovna&rsquo;s portrait, gazing at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you admire that sort of woman, prince?&rdquo; he asked, looking intently at
      him. He seemed to have some special object in the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wonderful face,&rdquo; said the prince, &ldquo;and I feel sure that her
      destiny is not by any means an ordinary, uneventful one. Her face is
      smiling enough, but she must have suffered terribly&mdash;hasn&rsquo;t she? Her
      eyes show it&mdash;those two bones there, the little points under her
      eyes, just where the cheek begins. It&rsquo;s a proud face too, terribly proud!
      And I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t say whether she is good and kind, or not. Oh, if she
      be but good! That would make all well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And would you marry a woman like that, now?&rdquo; continued Gania, never
      taking his excited eyes off the prince&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot marry at all,&rdquo; said the latter. &ldquo;I am an invalid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would Rogojin marry her, do you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? Certainly he would, I should think. He would marry her tomorrow!&mdash;marry
      her tomorrow and murder her in a week!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hardly had the prince uttered the last word when Gania gave such a fearful
      shudder that the prince almost cried out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; said he, seizing Gania&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your highness! His excellency begs your presence in her excellency&rsquo;s
      apartments!&rdquo; announced the footman, appearing at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince immediately followed the man out of the room.
    </p>
    <h3>
      IV.
    </h3>
    <p>
      All three of the Miss Epanchins were fine, healthy girls, well-grown, with
      good shoulders and busts, and strong&mdash;almost masculine&mdash;hands;
      and, of course, with all the above attributes, they enjoyed capital
      appetites, of which they were not in the least ashamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabetha Prokofievna sometimes informed the girls that they were a
      little too candid in this matter, but in spite of their outward deference
      to their mother these three young women, in solemn conclave, had long
      agreed to modify the unquestioning obedience which they had been in the
      habit of according to her; and Mrs. General Epanchin had judged it better
      to say nothing about it, though, of course, she was well aware of the
      fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is true that her nature sometimes rebelled against these dictates of
      reason, and that she grew yearly more capricious and impatient; but having
      a respectful and well-disciplined husband under her thumb at all times,
      she found it possible, as a rule, to empty any little accumulations of
      spleen upon his head, and therefore the harmony of the family was kept
      duly balanced, and things went as smoothly as family matters can.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Epanchin had a fair appetite herself, and generally took her share of
      the capital mid-day lunch which was always served for the girls, and which
      was nearly as good as a dinner. The young ladies used to have a cup of
      coffee each before this meal, at ten o&rsquo;clock, while still in bed. This was
      a favourite and unalterable arrangement with them. At half-past twelve,
      the table was laid in the small dining-room, and occasionally the general
      himself appeared at the family gathering, if he had time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides tea and coffee, cheese, honey, butter, pan-cakes of various kinds
      (the lady of the house loved these best), cutlets, and so on, there was
      generally strong beef soup, and other substantial delicacies.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the particular morning on which our story has opened, the family had
      assembled in the dining-room, and were waiting the general&rsquo;s appearance,
      the latter having promised to come this day. If he had been one moment
      late, he would have been sent for at once; but he turned up punctually.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he came forward to wish his wife good-morning and kiss her hands, as
      his custom was, he observed something in her look which boded ill. He
      thought he knew the reason, and had expected it, but still, he was not
      altogether comfortable. His daughters advanced to kiss him, too, and
      though they did not look exactly angry, there was something strange in
      their expression as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general was, owing to certain circumstances, a little inclined to be
      too suspicious at home, and needlessly nervous; but, as an experienced
      father and husband, he judged it better to take measures at once to
      protect himself from any dangers there might be in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, I hope I shall not interfere with the proper sequence of my
      narrative too much, if I diverge for a moment at this point, in order to
      explain the mutual relations between General Epanchin&rsquo;s family and others
      acting a part in this history, at the time when we take up the thread of
      their destiny. I have already stated that the general, though he was a man
      of lowly origin, and of poor education, was, for all that, an experienced
      and talented husband and father. Among other things, he considered it
      undesirable to hurry his daughters to the matrimonial altar and to worry
      them too much with assurances of his paternal wishes for their happiness,
      as is the custom among parents of many grown-up daughters. He even
      succeeded in ranging his wife on his side on this question, though he
      found the feat very difficult to accomplish, because unnatural; but the
      general&rsquo;s arguments were conclusive, and founded upon obvious facts. The
      general considered that the girls&rsquo; taste and good sense should be allowed
      to develop and mature deliberately, and that the parents&rsquo; duty should
      merely be to keep watch, in order that no strange or undesirable choice be
      made; but that the selection once effected, both father and mother were
      bound from that moment to enter heart and soul into the cause, and to see
      that the matter progressed without hindrance until the altar should be
      happily reached.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides this, it was clear that the Epanchins&rsquo; position gained each year,
      with geometrical accuracy, both as to financial solidity and social
      weight; and, therefore, the longer the girls waited, the better was their
      chance of making a brilliant match.
    </p>
    <p>
      But again, amidst the incontrovertible facts just recorded, one more,
      equally significant, rose up to confront the family; and this was, that
      the eldest daughter, Alexandra, had imperceptibly arrived at her
      twenty-fifth birthday. Almost at the same moment, Afanasy Ivanovitch
      Totski, a man of immense wealth, high connections, and good standing,
      announced his intention of marrying. Afanasy Ivanovitch was a gentleman of
      fifty-five years of age, artistically gifted, and of most refined tastes.
      He wished to marry well, and, moreover, he was a keen admirer and judge of
      beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, since Totski had, of late, been upon terms of great cordiality with
      Epanchin, which excellent relations were intensified by the fact that they
      were, so to speak, partners in several financial enterprises, it so
      happened that the former now put in a friendly request to the general for
      counsel with regard to the important step he meditated. Might he suggest,
      for instance, such a thing as a marriage between himself and one of the
      general&rsquo;s daughters?
    </p>
    <p>
      Evidently the quiet, pleasant current of the family life of the Epanchins
      was about to undergo a change.
    </p>
    <p>
      The undoubted beauty of the family, <i>par excellence</i>, was the
      youngest, Aglaya, as aforesaid. But Totski himself, though an egotist of
      the extremest type, realized that he had no chance there; Aglaya was
      clearly not for such as he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps the sisterly love and friendship of the three girls had more or
      less exaggerated Aglaya&rsquo;s chances of happiness. In their opinion, the
      latter&rsquo;s destiny was not merely to be very happy; she was to live in a
      heaven on earth. Aglaya&rsquo;s husband was to be a compendium of all the
      virtues, and of all success, not to speak of fabulous wealth. The two
      elder sisters had agreed that all was to be sacrificed by them, if need
      be, for Aglaya&rsquo;s sake; her dowry was to be colossal and unprecedented.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general and his wife were aware of this agreement, and, therefore,
      when Totski suggested himself for one of the sisters, the parents made no
      doubt that one of the two elder girls would probably accept the offer,
      since Totski would certainly make no difficulty as to dowry. The general
      valued the proposal very highly. He knew life, and realized what such an
      offer was worth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer of the sisters to the communication was, if not conclusive, at
      least consoling and hopeful. It made known that the eldest, Alexandra,
      would very likely be disposed to listen to a proposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alexandra was a good-natured girl, though she had a will of her own. She
      was intelligent and kind-hearted, and, if she were to marry Totski, she
      would make him a good wife. She did not care for a brilliant marriage; she
      was eminently a woman calculated to soothe and sweeten the life of any
      man; decidedly pretty, if not absolutely handsome. What better could
      Totski wish?
    </p>
    <p>
      So the matter crept slowly forward. The general and Totski had agreed to
      avoid any hasty and irrevocable step. Alexandra&rsquo;s parents had not even
      begun to talk to their daughters freely upon the subject, when suddenly,
      as it were, a dissonant chord was struck amid the harmony of the
      proceedings. Mrs. Epanchin began to show signs of discontent, and that was
      a serious matter. A certain circumstance had crept in, a disagreeable and
      troublesome factor, which threatened to overturn the whole business.
    </p>
    <p>
      This circumstance had come into existence eighteen years before. Close to
      an estate of Totski&rsquo;s, in one of the central provinces of Russia, there
      lived, at that time, a poor gentleman whose estate was of the wretchedest
      description. This gentleman was noted in the district for his persistent
      ill-fortune; his name was Barashkoff, and, as regards family and descent,
      he was vastly superior to Totski, but his estate was mortgaged to the last
      acre. One day, when he had ridden over to the town to see a creditor, the
      chief peasant of his village followed him shortly after, with the news
      that his house had been burnt down, and that his wife had perished with
      it, but his children were safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even Barashkoff, inured to the storms of evil fortune as he was, could not
      stand this last stroke. He went mad and died shortly after in the town
      hospital. His estate was sold for the creditors; and the little girls&mdash;two
      of them, of seven and eight years of age respectively,&mdash;were adopted
      by Totski, who undertook their maintenance and education in the kindness
      of his heart. They were brought up together with the children of his
      German bailiff. Very soon, however, there was only one of them left&mdash;Nastasia
      Philipovna&mdash;for the other little one died of whooping-cough. Totski,
      who was living abroad at this time, very soon forgot all about the child;
      but five years after, returning to Russia, it struck him that he would
      like to look over his estate and see how matters were going there, and,
      arrived at his bailiff&rsquo;s house, he was not long in discovering that among
      the children of the latter there now dwelt a most lovely little girl of
      twelve, sweet and intelligent, and bright, and promising to develop beauty
      of most unusual quality&mdash;as to which last Totski was an undoubted
      authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      He only stayed at his country seat a few days on this occasion, but he had
      time to make his arrangements. Great changes took place in the child&rsquo;s
      education; a good governess was engaged, a Swiss lady of experience and
      culture. For four years this lady resided in the house with little Nastia,
      and then the education was considered complete. The governess took her
      departure, and another lady came down to fetch Nastia, by Totski&rsquo;s
      instructions. The child was now transported to another of Totski&rsquo;s estates
      in a distant part of the country. Here she found a delightful little
      house, just built, and prepared for her reception with great care and
      taste; and here she took up her abode together with the lady who had
      accompanied her from her old home. In the house there were two experienced
      maids, musical instruments of all sorts, a charming &ldquo;young lady&rsquo;s
      library,&rdquo; pictures, paint-boxes, a lap-dog, and everything to make life
      agreeable. Within a fortnight Totski himself arrived, and from that time
      he appeared to have taken a great fancy to this part of the world and came
      down each summer, staying two and three months at a time. So passed four
      years peacefully and happily, in charming surroundings.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of that time, and about four months after Totski&rsquo;s last visit
      (he had stayed but a fortnight on this occasion), a report reached
      Nastasia Philipovna that he was about to be married in St. Petersburg, to
      a rich, eminent, and lovely woman. The report was only partially true, the
      marriage project being only in an embryo condition; but a great change now
      came over Nastasia Philipovna. She suddenly displayed unusual decision of
      character; and without wasting time in thought, she left her country home
      and came up to St. Petersburg, straight to Totski&rsquo;s house, all alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter, amazed at her conduct, began to express his displeasure; but
      he very soon became aware that he must change his voice, style, and
      everything else, with this young lady; the good old times were gone. An
      entirely new and different woman sat before him, between whom and the girl
      he had left in the country last July there seemed nothing in common.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first place, this new woman understood a good deal more than was
      usual for young people of her age; so much indeed, that Totski could not
      help wondering where she had picked up her knowledge. Surely not from her
      &ldquo;young lady&rsquo;s library&rdquo;? It even embraced legal matters, and the &ldquo;world&rdquo; in
      general, to a considerable extent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her character was absolutely changed. No more of the girlish alternations
      of timidity and petulance, the adorable naivete, the reveries, the tears,
      the playfulness... It was an entirely new and hitherto unknown being who
      now sat and laughed at him, and informed him to his face that she had
      never had the faintest feeling for him of any kind, except loathing and
      contempt&mdash;contempt which had followed closely upon her sensations of
      surprise and bewilderment after her first acquaintance with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      This new woman gave him further to understand that though it was
      absolutely the same to her whom he married, yet she had decided to prevent
      this marriage&mdash;for no particular reason, but that she <i>chose</i> to
      do so, and because she wished to amuse herself at his expense for that it
      was &ldquo;quite her turn to laugh a little now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such were her words&mdash;very likely she did not give her real reason for
      this eccentric conduct; but, at all events, that was all the explanation
      she deigned to offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Totski thought the matter over as well as his scattered ideas
      would permit. His meditations lasted a fortnight, however, and at the end
      of that time his resolution was taken. The fact was, Totski was at that
      time a man of fifty years of age; his position was solid and respectable;
      his place in society had long been firmly fixed upon safe foundations; he
      loved himself, his personal comforts, and his position better than all the
      world, as every respectable gentleman should!
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time his grasp of things in general soon showed Totski that he
      now had to deal with a being who was outside the pale of the ordinary
      rules of traditional behaviour, and who would not only threaten mischief
      but would undoubtedly carry it out, and stop for no one.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was evidently, he concluded, something at work here; some storm of
      the mind, some paroxysm of romantic anger, goodness knows against whom or
      what, some insatiable contempt&mdash;in a word, something altogether
      absurd and impossible, but at the same time most dangerous to be met with
      by any respectable person with a position in society to keep up.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a man of Totski&rsquo;s wealth and standing, it would, of course, have been
      the simplest possible matter to take steps which would rid him at once
      from all annoyance; while it was obviously impossible for Nastasia
      Philipovna to harm him in any way, either legally or by stirring up a
      scandal, for, in case of the latter danger, he could so easily remove her
      to a sphere of safety. However, these arguments would only hold good in
      case of Nastasia acting as others might in such an emergency. She was much
      more likely to overstep the bounds of reasonable conduct by some
      extraordinary eccentricity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the sound judgment of Totski stood him in good stead. He realized
      that Nastasia Philipovna must be well aware that she could do nothing by
      legal means to injure him, and that her flashing eyes betrayed some
      entirely different intention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nastasia Philipovna was quite capable of ruining herself, and even of
      perpetrating something which would send her to Siberia, for the mere
      pleasure of injuring a man for whom she had developed so inhuman a sense
      of loathing and contempt. He had sufficient insight to understand that she
      valued nothing in the world&mdash;herself least of all&mdash;and he made
      no attempt to conceal the fact that he was a coward in some respects. For
      instance, if he had been told that he would be stabbed at the altar, or
      publicly insulted, he would undoubtedly have been frightened; but not so
      much at the idea of being murdered, or wounded, or insulted, as at the
      thought that if such things were to happen he would be made to look
      ridiculous in the eyes of society.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew well that Nastasia thoroughly understood him and where to wound
      him and how, and therefore, as the marriage was still only in embryo,
      Totski decided to conciliate her by giving it up. His decision was
      strengthened by the fact that Nastasia Philipovna had curiously altered of
      late. It would be difficult to conceive how different she was physically,
      at the present time, to the girl of a few years ago. She was pretty
      then... but now!... Totski laughed angrily when he thought how
      short-sighted he had been. In days gone by he remembered how he had looked
      at her beautiful eyes, how even then he had marvelled at their dark
      mysterious depths, and at their wondering gaze which seemed to seek an
      answer to some unknown riddle. Her complexion also had altered. She was
      now exceedingly pale, but, curiously, this change only made her more
      beautiful. Like most men of the world, Totski had rather despised such a
      cheaply-bought conquest, but of late years he had begun to think
      differently about it. It had struck him as long ago as last spring that he
      ought to be finding a good match for Nastasia; for instance, some
      respectable and reasonable young fellow serving in a government office in
      another part of the country. How maliciously Nastasia laughed at the idea
      of such a thing, now!
    </p>
    <p>
      However, it appeared to Totski that he might make use of her in another
      way; and he determined to establish her in St. Petersburg, surrounding her
      with all the comforts and luxuries that his wealth could command. In this
      way he might gain glory in certain circles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five years of this Petersburg life went by, and, of course, during that
      time a great deal happened. Totski&rsquo;s position was very uncomfortable;
      having &ldquo;funked&rdquo; once, he could not totally regain his ease. He was afraid,
      he did not know why, but he was simply <i>afraid</i> of Nastasia
      Philipovna. For the first two years or so he had suspected that she wished
      to marry him herself, and that only her vanity prevented her telling him
      so. He thought that she wanted him to approach her with a humble proposal
      from his own side. But to his great, and not entirely pleasurable
      amazement, he discovered that this was by no means the case, and that were
      he to offer himself he would be refused. He could not understand such a
      state of things, and was obliged to conclude that it was pride, the pride
      of an injured and imaginative woman, which had gone to such lengths that
      it preferred to sit and nurse its contempt and hatred in solitude rather
      than mount to heights of hitherto unattainable splendour. To make matters
      worse, she was quite impervious to mercenary considerations, and could not
      be bribed in any way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, Totski took cunning means to try to break his chains and be free.
      He tried to tempt her in various ways to lose her heart; he invited
      princes, hussars, secretaries of embassies, poets, novelists, even
      Socialists, to see her; but not one of them all made the faintest
      impression upon Nastasia. It was as though she had a pebble in place of a
      heart, as though her feelings and affections were dried up and withered
      for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      She lived almost entirely alone; she read, she studied, she loved music.
      Her principal acquaintances were poor women of various grades, a couple of
      actresses, and the family of a poor schoolteacher. Among these people she
      was much beloved.
    </p>
    <p>
      She received four or five friends sometimes, of an evening. Totski often
      came. Lately, too, General Epanchin had been enabled with great difficulty
      to introduce himself into her circle. Gania made her acquaintance also,
      and others were Ferdishenko, an ill-bred, and would-be witty, young clerk,
      and Ptitsin, a money-lender of modest and polished manners, who had risen
      from poverty. In fact, Nastasia Philipovna&rsquo;s beauty became a thing known
      to all the town; but not a single man could boast of anything more than
      his own admiration for her; and this reputation of hers, and her wit and
      culture and grace, all confirmed Totski in the plan he had now prepared.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it was at this moment that General Epanchin began to play so large and
      important a part in the story.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Totski had approached the general with his request for friendly
      counsel as to a marriage with one of his daughters, he had made a full and
      candid confession. He had said that he intended to stop at no means to
      obtain his freedom; even if Nastasia were to promise to leave him entirely
      alone in future, he would not (he said) believe and trust her; words were
      not enough for him; he must have solid guarantees of some sort. So he and
      the general determined to try what an attempt to appeal to her heart would
      effect. Having arrived at Nastasia&rsquo;s house one day, with Epanchin, Totski
      immediately began to speak of the intolerable torment of his position. He
      admitted that he was to blame for all, but candidly confessed that he
      could not bring himself to feel any remorse for his original guilt towards
      herself, because he was a man of sensual passions which were inborn and
      ineradicable, and that he had no power over himself in this respect; but
      that he wished, seriously, to marry at last, and that the whole fate of
      the most desirable social union which he contemplated, was in her hands;
      in a word, he confided his all to her generosity of heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Epanchin took up his part and spoke in the character of father of
      a family; he spoke sensibly, and without wasting words over any attempt at
      sentimentality, he merely recorded his full admission of her right to be
      the arbiter of Totski&rsquo;s destiny at this moment. He then pointed out that
      the fate of his daughter, and very likely of both his other daughters, now
      hung upon her reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Nastasia&rsquo;s question as to what they wished her to do, Totski confessed
      that he had been so frightened by her, five years ago, that he could never
      now be entirely comfortable until she herself married. He immediately
      added that such a suggestion from him would, of course, be absurd, unless
      accompanied by remarks of a more pointed nature. He very well knew, he
      said, that a certain young gentleman of good family, namely, Gavrila
      Ardalionovitch Ivolgin, with whom she was acquainted, and whom she
      received at her house, had long loved her passionately, and would give his
      life for some response from her. The young fellow had confessed this love
      of his to him (Totski) and had also admitted it in the hearing of his
      benefactor, General Epanchin. Lastly, he could not help being of opinion
      that Nastasia must be aware of Gania&rsquo;s love for her, and if he (Totski)
      mistook not, she had looked with some favour upon it, being often lonely,
      and rather tired of her present life. Having remarked how difficult it was
      for him, of all people, to speak to her of these matters, Totski concluded
      by saying that he trusted Nastasia Philipovna would not look with contempt
      upon him if he now expressed his sincere desire to guarantee her future by
      a gift of seventy-five thousand roubles. He added that the sum would have
      been left her all the same in his will, and that therefore she must not
      consider the gift as in any way an indemnification to her for anything,
      but that there was no reason, after all, why a man should not be allowed
      to entertain a natural desire to lighten his conscience, etc., etc.; in
      fact, all that would naturally be said under the circumstances. Totski was
      very eloquent all through, and, in conclusion, just touched on the fact
      that not a soul in the world, not even General Epanchin, had ever heard a
      word about the above seventy-five thousand roubles, and that this was the
      first time he had ever given expression to his intentions in respect to
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nastasia Philipovna&rsquo;s reply to this long rigmarole astonished both the
      friends considerably.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only was there no trace of her former irony, of her old hatred and
      enmity, and of that dreadful laughter, the very recollection of which sent
      a cold chill down Totski&rsquo;s back to this very day; but she seemed charmed
      and really glad to have the opportunity of talking seriously with him for
      once in a way. She confessed that she had long wished to have a frank and
      free conversation and to ask for friendly advice, but that pride had
      hitherto prevented her; now, however, that the ice was broken, nothing
      could be more welcome to her than this opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, with a sad smile, and then with a twinkle of merriment in her eyes,
      she admitted that such a storm as that of five years ago was now quite out
      of the question. She said that she had long since changed her views of
      things, and recognized that facts must be taken into consideration in
      spite of the feelings of the heart. What was done was done and ended, and
      she could not understand why Totski should still feel alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She next turned to General Epanchin and observed, most courteously, that
      she had long since known of his daughters, and that she had heard none but
      good report; that she had learned to think of them with deep and sincere
      respect. The idea alone that she could in any way serve them, would be to
      her both a pride and a source of real happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was true that she was lonely in her present life; Totski had judged her
      thoughts aright. She longed to rise, if not to love, at least to family
      life and new hopes and objects, but as to Gavrila Ardalionovitch, she
      could not as yet say much. She thought it must be the case that he loved
      her; she felt that she too might learn to love him, if she could be sure
      of the firmness of his attachment to herself; but he was very young, and
      it was a difficult question to decide. What she specially liked about him
      was that he worked, and supported his family by his toil.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had heard that he was proud and ambitious; she had heard much that was
      interesting of his mother and sister, she had heard of them from Mr.
      Ptitsin, and would much like to make their acquaintance, but&mdash;another
      question!&mdash;would they like to receive her into their house? At all
      events, though she did not reject the idea of this marriage, she desired
      not to be hurried. As for the seventy-five thousand roubles, Mr. Totski
      need not have found any difficulty or awkwardness about the matter; she
      quite understood the value of money, and would, of course, accept the
      gift. She thanked him for his delicacy, however, but saw no reason why
      Gavrila Ardalionovitch should not know about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would not marry the latter, she said, until she felt persuaded that
      neither on his part nor on the part of his family did there exist any sort
      of concealed suspicions as to herself. She did not intend to ask
      forgiveness for anything in the past, which fact she desired to be known.
      She did not consider herself to blame for anything that had happened in
      former years, and she thought that Gavrila Ardalionovitch should be
      informed as to the relations which had existed between herself and Totski
      during the last five years. If she accepted this money it was not to be
      considered as indemnification for her misfortune as a young girl, which
      had not been in any degree her own fault, but merely as compensation for
      her ruined life.
    </p>
    <p>
      She became so excited and agitated during all these explanations and
      confessions that General Epanchin was highly gratified, and considered the
      matter satisfactorily arranged once for all. But the once bitten Totski
      was twice shy, and looked for hidden snakes among the flowers. However,
      the special point to which the two friends particularly trusted to bring
      about their object (namely, Gania&rsquo;s attractiveness for Nastasia
      Philipovna), stood out more and more prominently; the pourparlers had
      commenced, and gradually even Totski began to believe in the possibility
      of success.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before long Nastasia and Gania had talked the matter over. Very little was
      said&mdash;her modesty seemed to suffer under the infliction of discussing
      such a question. But she recognized his love, on the understanding that
      she bound herself to nothing whatever, and that she reserved the right to
      say &ldquo;no&rdquo; up to the very hour of the marriage ceremony. Gania was to have
      the same right of refusal at the last moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      It soon became clear to Gania, after scenes of wrath and quarrellings at
      the domestic hearth, that his family were seriously opposed to the match,
      and that Nastasia was aware of this fact was equally evident. She said
      nothing about it, though he daily expected her to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were several rumours afloat, before long, which upset Totski&rsquo;s
      equanimity a good deal, but we will not now stop to describe them; merely
      mentioning an instance or two. One was that Nastasia had entered into
      close and secret relations with the Epanchin girls&mdash;a most unlikely
      rumour; another was that Nastasia had long satisfied herself of the fact
      that Gania was merely marrying her for money, and that his nature was
      gloomy and greedy, impatient and selfish, to an extraordinary degree; and
      that although he had been keen enough in his desire to achieve a conquest
      before, yet since the two friends had agreed to exploit his passion for
      their own purposes, it was clear enough that he had begun to consider the
      whole thing a nuisance and a nightmare.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his heart passion and hate seemed to hold divided sway, and although he
      had at last given his consent to marry the woman (as he said), under the
      stress of circumstances, yet he promised himself that he would &ldquo;take it
      out of her,&rdquo; after marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nastasia seemed to Totski to have divined all this, and to be preparing
      something on her own account, which frightened him to such an extent that
      he did not dare communicate his views even to the general. But at times he
      would pluck up his courage and be full of hope and good spirits again,
      acting, in fact, as weak men do act in such circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, both the friends felt that the thing looked rosy indeed when one
      day Nastasia informed them that she would give her final answer on the
      evening of her birthday, which anniversary was due in a very short time.
    </p>
    <p>
      A strange rumour began to circulate, meanwhile; no less than that the
      respectable and highly respected General Epanchin was himself so
      fascinated by Nastasia Philipovna that his feeling for her amounted almost
      to passion. What he thought to gain by Gania&rsquo;s marriage to the girl it was
      difficult to imagine. Possibly he counted on Gania&rsquo;s complaisance; for
      Totski had long suspected that there existed some secret understanding
      between the general and his secretary. At all events the fact was known
      that he had prepared a magnificent present of pearls for Nastasia&rsquo;s
      birthday, and that he was looking forward to the occasion when he should
      present his gift with the greatest excitement and impatience. The day
      before her birthday he was in a fever of agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Epanchin, long accustomed to her husband&rsquo;s infidelities, had heard of
      the pearls, and the rumour excited her liveliest curiosity and interest.
      The general remarked her suspicions, and felt that a grand explanation
      must shortly take place&mdash;which fact alarmed him much.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the reason why he was so unwilling to take lunch (on the morning
      upon which we took up this narrative) with the rest of his family. Before
      the prince&rsquo;s arrival he had made up his mind to plead business, and &ldquo;cut&rdquo;
       the meal; which simply meant running away.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was particularly anxious that this one day should be passed&mdash;especially
      the evening&mdash;without unpleasantness between himself and his family;
      and just at the right moment the prince turned up&mdash;&ldquo;as though Heaven
      had sent him on purpose,&rdquo; said the general to himself, as he left the
      study to seek out the wife of his bosom.
    </p>
    <h3>
      V.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Mrs. General Epanchin was a proud woman by nature. What must her feelings
      have been when she heard that Prince Muishkin, the last of his and her
      line, had arrived in beggar&rsquo;s guise, a wretched idiot, a recipient of
      charity&mdash;all of which details the general gave out for greater
      effect! He was anxious to steal her interest at the first swoop, so as to
      distract her thoughts from other matters nearer home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Epanchin was in the habit of holding herself very straight, and
      staring before her, without speaking, in moments of excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a fine woman of the same age as her husband, with a slightly
      hooked nose, a high, narrow forehead, thick hair turning a little grey,
      and a sallow complexion. Her eyes were grey and wore a very curious
      expression at times. She believed them to be most effective&mdash;a belief
      that nothing could alter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, receive him! Now, at once?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Epanchin, gazing vaguely at
      her husband as he stood fidgeting before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear me, I assure you there is no need to stand on ceremony with
      him,&rdquo; the general explained hastily. &ldquo;He is quite a child, not to say a
      pathetic-looking creature. He has fits of some sort, and has just arrived
      from Switzerland, straight from the station, dressed like a German and
      without a farthing in his pocket. I gave him twenty-five roubles to go on
      with, and am going to find him some easy place in one of the government
      offices. I should like you to ply him well with the victuals, my dears,
      for I should think he must be very hungry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You astonish me,&rdquo; said the lady, gazing as before. &ldquo;Fits, and hungry too!
      What sort of fits?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, they don&rsquo;t come on frequently, besides, he&rsquo;s a regular child, though
      he seems to be fairly educated. I should like you, if possible, my dears,&rdquo;
       the general added, making slowly for the door, &ldquo;to put him through his
      paces a bit, and see what he is good for. I think you should be kind to
      him; it is a good deed, you know&mdash;however, just as you like, of
      course&mdash;but he is a sort of relation, remember, and I thought it
      might interest you to see the young fellow, seeing that this is so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, of course, mamma, if we needn&rsquo;t stand on ceremony with him, we must
      give the poor fellow something to eat after his journey; especially as he
      has not the least idea where to go to,&rdquo; said Alexandra, the eldest of the
      girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides, he&rsquo;s quite a child; we can entertain him with a little
      hide-and-seek, in case of need,&rdquo; said Adelaida.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hide-and-seek? What do you mean?&rdquo; inquired Mrs. Epanchin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, do stop pretending, mamma,&rdquo; cried Aglaya, in vexation. &ldquo;Send him up,
      father; mother allows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The general rang the bell and gave orders that the prince should be shown
      in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only on condition that he has a napkin under his chin at lunch, then,&rdquo;
       said Mrs. Epanchin, &ldquo;and let Fedor, or Mavra, stand behind him while he
      eats. Is he quiet when he has these fits? He doesn&rsquo;t show violence, does
      he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, he seems to be very well brought up. His manners are
      excellent&mdash;but here he is himself. Here you are, prince&mdash;let me
      introduce you, the last of the Muishkins, a relative of your own, my dear,
      or at least of the same name. Receive him kindly, please. They&rsquo;ll bring in
      lunch directly, prince; you must stop and have some, but you must excuse
      me. I&rsquo;m in a hurry, I must be off&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We all know where <i>you</i> must be off to!&rdquo; said Mrs. Epanchin, in a
      meaning voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes&mdash;I must hurry away, I&rsquo;m late! Look here, dears, let him
      write you something in your albums; you&rsquo;ve no idea what a wonderful
      caligraphist he is, wonderful talent! He has just written out &lsquo;Abbot
      Pafnute signed this&rsquo; for me. Well, <i>au revoir!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop a minute; where are you off to? Who is this abbot?&rdquo; cried Mrs.
      Epanchin to her retreating husband in a tone of excited annoyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my dear, it was an old abbot of that name&mdash;I must be off to see the
      count, he&rsquo;s waiting for me, I&rsquo;m late&mdash;Good-bye! <i>Au revoir</i>,
      prince!&rdquo;&mdash;and the general bolted at full speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes&mdash;I know what count you&rsquo;re going to see!&rdquo; remarked his wife
      in a cutting manner, as she turned her angry eyes on the prince. &ldquo;Now
      then, what&rsquo;s all this about?&mdash;What abbot&mdash;Who&rsquo;s Pafnute?&rdquo; she
      added, brusquely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma!&rdquo; said Alexandra, shocked at her rudeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aglaya stamped her foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! Let me alone!&rdquo; said the angry mother. &ldquo;Now then, prince, sit
      down here, no, nearer, come nearer the light! I want to have a good look
      at you. So, now then, who is this abbot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Abbot Pafnute,&rdquo; said our friend, seriously and with deference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pafnute, yes. And who was he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Epanchin put these questions hastily and brusquely, and when the
      prince answered she nodded her head sagely at each word he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Abbot Pafnute lived in the fourteenth century,&rdquo; began the prince; &ldquo;he
      was in charge of one of the monasteries on the Volga, about where our
      present Kostroma government lies. He went to Oreol and helped in the great
      matters then going on in the religious world; he signed an edict there,
      and I have seen a print of his signature; it struck me, so I copied it.
      When the general asked me, in his study, to write something for him, to
      show my handwriting, I wrote &lsquo;The Abbot Pafnute signed this,&rsquo; in the exact
      handwriting of the abbot. The general liked it very much, and that&rsquo;s why
      he recalled it just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aglaya, make a note of &lsquo;Pafnute,&rsquo; or we shall forget him. H&rsquo;m! and where
      is this signature?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it was left on the general&rsquo;s table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let it be sent for at once!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll write you a new one in half a minute,&rdquo; said the prince, &ldquo;if you
      like!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, mamma!&rdquo; said Alexandra. &ldquo;But let&rsquo;s have lunch now, we are all
      hungry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; come along, prince,&rdquo; said the mother, &ldquo;are you very hungry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I must say that I am pretty hungry, thanks very much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m! I like to see that you know your manners; and you are by no means
      such a person as the general thought fit to describe you. Come along; you
      sit here, opposite to me,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;I wish to be able to see your
      face. Alexandra, Adelaida, look after the prince! He doesn&rsquo;t seem so very
      ill, does he? I don&rsquo;t think he requires a napkin under his chin, after
      all; are you accustomed to having one on, prince?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Formerly, when I was seven years old or so. I believe I wore one; but now
      I usually hold my napkin on my knee when I eat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, of course! And about your fits?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fits?&rdquo; asked the prince, slightly surprised. &ldquo;I very seldom have fits
      nowadays. I don&rsquo;t know how it may be here, though; they say the climate
      may be bad for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He talks very well, you know!&rdquo; said Mrs. Epanchin, who still continued to
      nod at each word the prince spoke. &ldquo;I really did not expect it at all; in
      fact, I suppose it was all stuff and nonsense on the general&rsquo;s part, as
      usual. Eat away, prince, and tell me where you were born, and where you
      were brought up. I wish to know all about you, you interest me very much!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince expressed his thanks once more, and eating heartily the while,
      recommenced the narrative of his life in Switzerland, all of which we have
      heard before. Mrs. Epanchin became more and more pleased with her guest;
      the girls, too, listened with considerable attention. In talking over the
      question of relationship it turned out that the prince was very well up in
      the matter and knew his pedigree off by heart. It was found that scarcely
      any connection existed between himself and Mrs. Epanchin, but the talk,
      and the opportunity of conversing about her family tree, gratified the
      latter exceedingly, and she rose from the table in great good humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s all go to my boudoir,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and they shall bring some coffee
      in there. That&rsquo;s the room where we all assemble and busy ourselves as we
      like best,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;Alexandra, my eldest, here, plays the piano,
      or reads or sews; Adelaida paints landscapes and portraits (but never
      finishes any); and Aglaya sits and does nothing. I don&rsquo;t work too much,
      either. Here we are, now; sit down, prince, near the fire and talk to us.
      I want to hear you relate something. I wish to make sure of you first and
      then tell my old friend, Princess Bielokonski, about you. I wish you to
      know all the good people and to interest them. Now then, begin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma, it&rsquo;s rather a strange order, that!&rdquo; said Adelaida, who was fussing
      among her paints and paint-brushes at the easel. Aglaya and Alexandra had
      settled themselves with folded hands on a sofa, evidently meaning to be
      listeners. The prince felt that the general attention was concentrated
      upon himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should refuse to say a word if <i>I</i> were ordered to tell a story
      like that!&rdquo; observed Aglaya.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? what&rsquo;s there strange about it? He has a tongue. Why shouldn&rsquo;t he
      tell us something? I want to judge whether he is a good story-teller;
      anything you like, prince&mdash;how you liked Switzerland, what was your first
      impression, anything. You&rsquo;ll see, he&rsquo;ll begin directly and tell us all
      about it beautifully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The impression was forcible&mdash;&rdquo; the prince began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, you see, girls,&rdquo; said the impatient lady, &ldquo;he <i>has</i> begun,
      you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, <i>let</i> him talk, mamma,&rdquo; said Alexandra. &ldquo;This prince is
      a great humbug and by no means an idiot,&rdquo; she whispered to Aglaya.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I saw that at once,&rdquo; replied the latter. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it at all
      nice of him to play a part. What does he wish to gain by it, I wonder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My first impression was a very strong one,&rdquo; repeated the prince. &ldquo;When
      they took me away from Russia, I remember I passed through many German
      towns and looked out of the windows, but did not trouble so much as to ask
      questions about them. This was after a long series of fits. I always used
      to fall into a sort of torpid condition after such a series, and lost my
      memory almost entirely; and though I was not altogether without reason at
      such times, yet I had no logical power of thought. This would continue for
      three or four days, and then I would recover myself again. I remember my
      melancholy was intolerable; I felt inclined to cry; I sat and wondered and
      wondered uncomfortably; the consciousness that everything was strange
      weighed terribly upon me; I could understand that it was all foreign and
      strange. I recollect I awoke from this state for the first time at Basle,
      one evening; the bray of a donkey aroused me, a donkey in the town market.
      I saw the donkey and was extremely pleased with it, and from that moment
      my head seemed to clear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A donkey? How strange! Yet it is not strange. Anyone of us might fall in
      love with a donkey! It happened in mythological times,&rdquo; said Madame
      Epanchin, looking wrathfully at her daughters, who had begun to laugh. &ldquo;Go
      on, prince.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since that evening I have been specially fond of donkeys. I began to ask
      questions about them, for I had never seen one before; and I at once came
      to the conclusion that this must be one of the most useful of animals&mdash;strong,
      willing, patient, cheap; and, thanks to this donkey, I began to like the
      whole country I was travelling through; and my melancholy passed away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All this is very strange and interesting,&rdquo; said Mrs. Epanchin. &ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s
      leave the donkey and go on to other matters. What are you laughing at,
      Aglaya? and you too, Adelaida? The prince told us his experiences very
      cleverly; he saw the donkey himself, and what have you ever seen? <i>You</i>
      have never been abroad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have seen a donkey though, mamma!&rdquo; said Aglaya.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve heard one!&rdquo; said Adelaida. All three of the girls laughed out
      loud, and the prince laughed with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s too bad of you,&rdquo; said mamma. &ldquo;You must forgive them, prince;
      they are good girls. I am very fond of them, though I often have to be
      scolding them; they are all as silly and mad as march hares.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, why shouldn&rsquo;t they laugh?&rdquo; said the prince. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have let the
      chance go by in their place, I know. But I stick up for the donkey, all
      the same; he&rsquo;s a patient, good-natured fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you a patient man, prince? I ask out of curiosity,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Epanchin.
    </p>
    <p>
      All laughed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that wretched donkey again, I see!&rdquo; cried the lady. &ldquo;I assure you,
      prince, I was not guilty of the least&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Insinuation? Oh! I assure you, I take your word for it.&rdquo; And the prince
      continued laughing merrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must say it&rsquo;s very nice of you to laugh. I see you really are a
      kind-hearted fellow,&rdquo; said Mrs. Epanchin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not always kind, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am kind myself, and <i>always</i> kind too, if you please!&rdquo; she
      retorted, unexpectedly; &ldquo;and that is my chief fault, for one ought not to
      be always kind. I am often angry with these girls and their father; but
      the worst of it is, I am always kindest when I am cross. I was very angry
      just before you came, and Aglaya there read me a lesson&mdash;thanks,
      Aglaya, dear&mdash;come and kiss me&mdash;there&mdash;that&rsquo;s enough&rdquo; she
      added, as Aglaya came forward and kissed her lips and then her hand. &ldquo;Now
      then, go on, prince. Perhaps you can think of something more exciting than
      about the donkey, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must say, again, <i>I</i> can&rsquo;t understand how you can expect anyone to
      tell you stories straight away, so,&rdquo; said Adelaida. &ldquo;I know I never
      could!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but the prince can, because he is clever&mdash;cleverer than you are
      by ten or twenty times, if you like. There, that&rsquo;s so, prince; and
      seriously, let&rsquo;s drop the donkey now&mdash;what else did you see abroad,
      besides the donkey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but the prince told us about the donkey very cleverly, all the
      same,&rdquo; said Alexandra. &ldquo;I have always been most interested to hear how
      people go mad and get well again, and that sort of thing. Especially when
      it happens suddenly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so, quite so!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Epanchin, delighted. &ldquo;I see you <i>can</i>
      be sensible now and then, Alexandra. You were speaking of Switzerland,
      prince?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. We came to Lucerne, and I was taken out in a boat. I felt how lovely
      it was, but the loveliness weighed upon me somehow or other, and made me
      feel melancholy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Alexandra.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; I always feel like that when I look at the beauties of
      nature for the first time; but then, I was ill at that time, of course!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but I should like to see it!&rdquo; said Adelaida; &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t know <i>when</i>
      we shall ever go abroad. I&rsquo;ve been two years looking out for a good
      subject for a picture. I&rsquo;ve done all I know. &lsquo;The North and South I know
      by heart,&rsquo; as our poet observes. Do help me to a subject, prince.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but I know nothing about painting. It seems to me one only has to
      look, and paint what one sees.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t know <i>how</i> to see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, what rubbish you talk!&rdquo; the mother struck in. &ldquo;Not know how to
      see! Open your eyes and look! If you can&rsquo;t see here, you won&rsquo;t see abroad
      either. Tell us what you saw yourself, prince!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s better,&rdquo; said Adelaida; &ldquo;the prince <i>learned to see</i>
      abroad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I hardly know! You see, I only went to restore my health. I don&rsquo;t
      know whether I learned to see, exactly. I was very happy, however, nearly
      all the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Happy! you can be happy?&rdquo; cried Aglaya. &ldquo;Then how can you say you did not
      learn to see? I should think you could teach <i>us</i> to see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! <i>do</i> teach us,&rdquo; laughed Adelaida.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I can&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; said the prince, laughing too. &ldquo;I lived almost all
      the while in one little Swiss village; what can I teach you? At first I
      was only just not absolutely dull; then my health began to improve&mdash;then
      every day became dearer and more precious to me, and the longer I stayed,
      the dearer became the time to me; so much so that I could not help
      observing it; but why this was so, it would be difficult to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that you didn&rsquo;t care to go away anywhere else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, at first I did; I was restless; I didn&rsquo;t know however I should
      manage to support life&mdash;you know there are such moments, especially
      in solitude. There was a waterfall near us, such a lovely thin streak of
      water, like a thread but white and moving. It fell from a great height,
      but it looked quite low, and it was half a mile away, though it did not
      seem fifty paces. I loved to listen to it at night, but it was then that I
      became so restless. Sometimes I went and climbed the mountain and stood
      there in the midst of the tall pines, all alone in the terrible silence,
      with our little village in the distance, and the sky so blue, and the sun
      so bright, and an old ruined castle on the mountain-side, far away. I used
      to watch the line where earth and sky met, and longed to go and seek there
      the key of all mysteries, thinking that I might find there a new life,
      perhaps some great city where life should be grander and richer&mdash;and
      then it struck me that life may be grand enough even in a prison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I read that last most praiseworthy thought in my manual, when I was
      twelve years old,&rdquo; said Aglaya.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All this is pure philosophy,&rdquo; said Adelaida. &ldquo;You are a philosopher,
      prince, and have come here to instruct us in your views.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you are right,&rdquo; said the prince, smiling. &ldquo;I think I am a
      philosopher, perhaps, and who knows, perhaps I do wish to teach my views
      of things to those I meet with?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your philosophy is rather like that of an old woman we know, who is rich
      and yet does nothing but try how little she can spend. She talks of
      nothing but money all day. Your great philosophical idea of a grand life
      in a prison and your four happy years in that Swiss village are like this,
      rather,&rdquo; said Aglaya.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to life in a prison, of course there may be two opinions,&rdquo; said the
      prince. &ldquo;I once heard the story of a man who lived twelve years in a
      prison&mdash;I heard it from the man himself. He was one of the persons
      under treatment with my professor; he had fits, and attacks of melancholy,
      then he would weep, and once he tried to commit suicide. <i>His</i> life
      in prison was sad enough; his only acquaintances were spiders and a tree
      that grew outside his grating&mdash;but I think I had better tell you of another
      man I met last year. There was a very strange feature in this case,
      strange because of its extremely rare occurrence. This man had once been
      brought to the scaffold in company with several others, and had had the
      sentence of death by shooting passed upon him for some political crime.
      Twenty minutes later he had been reprieved and some other punishment
      substituted; but the interval between the two sentences, twenty minutes,
      or at least a quarter of an hour, had been passed in the certainty that
      within a few minutes he must die. I was very anxious to hear him speak of
      his impressions during that dreadful time, and I several times inquired of
      him as to what he thought and felt. He remembered everything with the most
      accurate and extraordinary distinctness, and declared that he would never
      forget a single iota of the experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About twenty paces from the scaffold, where he had stood to hear the
      sentence, were three posts, fixed in the ground, to which to fasten the
      criminals (of whom there were several). The first three criminals were
      taken to the posts, dressed in long white tunics, with white caps drawn
      over their faces, so that they could not see the rifles pointed at them.
      Then a group of soldiers took their stand opposite to each post. My friend
      was the eighth on the list, and therefore he would have been among the
      third lot to go up. A priest went about among them with a cross: and there
      was about five minutes of time left for him to live.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said that those five minutes seemed to him to be a most interminable
      period, an enormous wealth of time; he seemed to be living, in these
      minutes, so many lives that there was no need as yet to think of that last
      moment, so that he made several arrangements, dividing up the time into
      portions&mdash;one for saying farewell to his companions, two minutes for
      that; then a couple more for thinking over his own life and career and all
      about himself; and another minute for a last look around. He remembered
      having divided his time like this quite well. While saying good-bye to his
      friends he recollected asking one of them some very usual everyday
      question, and being much interested in the answer. Then having bade
      farewell, he embarked upon those two minutes which he had allotted to
      looking into himself; he knew beforehand what he was going to think about.
      He wished to put it to himself as quickly and clearly as possible, that
      here was he, a living, thinking man, and that in three minutes he would be
      nobody; or if somebody or something, then what and where? He thought he
      would decide this question once for all in these last three minutes. A
      little way off there stood a church, and its gilded spire glittered in the
      sun. He remembered staring stubbornly at this spire, and at the rays of
      light sparkling from it. He could not tear his eyes from these rays of
      light; he got the idea that these rays were his new nature, and that in
      three minutes he would become one of them, amalgamated somehow with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The repugnance to what must ensue almost immediately, and the
      uncertainty, were dreadful, he said; but worst of all was the idea, &lsquo;What
      should I do if I were not to die now? What if I were to return to life
      again? What an eternity of days, and all mine! How I should grudge and
      count up every minute of it, so as to waste not a single instant!&rsquo; He said
      that this thought weighed so upon him and became such a terrible burden
      upon his brain that he could not bear it, and wished they would shoot him
      quickly and have done with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince paused and all waited, expecting him to go on again and finish
      the story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; asked Aglaya.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All? Yes,&rdquo; said the prince, emerging from a momentary reverie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why did you tell us this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I happened to recall it, that&rsquo;s all! It fitted into the conversation&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You probably wish to deduce, prince,&rdquo; said Alexandra, &ldquo;that moments of
      time cannot be reckoned by money value, and that sometimes five minutes
      are worth priceless treasures. All this is very praiseworthy; but may I
      ask about this friend of yours, who told you the terrible experience of
      his life? He was reprieved, you say; in other words, they did restore to
      him that &lsquo;eternity of days.&rsquo; What did he do with these riches of time? Did
      he keep careful account of his minutes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no, he didn&rsquo;t! I asked him myself. He said that he had not lived a bit
      as he had intended, and had wasted many, and many a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then there&rsquo;s an experiment, and the thing is proved; one
      cannot live and count each moment; say what you like, but one <i>cannot</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said the prince, &ldquo;I have thought so myself. And yet, why
      shouldn&rsquo;t one do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think, then, that you could live more wisely than other people?&rdquo; said
      Aglaya.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have had that idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have it still?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I have it still,&rdquo; the prince replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had contemplated Aglaya until now, with a pleasant though rather timid
      smile, but as the last words fell from his lips he began to laugh, and
      looked at her merrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not very modest!&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how brave you are!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You are laughing, and I&mdash;that
      man&rsquo;s tale impressed me so much, that I dreamt of it afterwards; yes, I
      dreamt of those five minutes...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at his listeners again with that same serious, searching
      expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not angry with me?&rdquo; he asked suddenly, and with a kind of nervous
      hurry, although he looked them straight in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should we be angry?&rdquo; they cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only because I seem to be giving you a lecture, all the time!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this they laughed heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t be angry with me,&rdquo; continued the prince. &ldquo;I know very well
      that I have seen less of life than other people, and have less knowledge
      of it. I must appear to speak strangely sometimes...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He said the last words nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say you have been happy, and that proves you have lived, not less,
      but more than other people. Why make all these excuses?&rdquo; interrupted
      Aglaya in a mocking tone of voice. &ldquo;Besides, you need not mind about
      lecturing us; you have nothing to boast of. With your quietism, one could
      live happily for a hundred years at least. One might show you the
      execution of a felon, or show you one&rsquo;s little finger. You could draw a
      moral from either, and be quite satisfied. That sort of existence is easy
      enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand why you always fly into a temper,&rdquo; said Mrs. Epanchin,
      who had been listening to the conversation and examining the faces of the
      speakers in turn. &ldquo;I do not understand what you mean. What has your little
      finger to do with it? The prince talks well, though he is not amusing. He
      began all right, but now he seems sad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, mamma! Prince, I wish you had seen an execution,&rdquo; said
      Aglaya. &ldquo;I should like to ask you a question about that, if you had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have seen an execution,&rdquo; said the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have!&rdquo; cried Aglaya. &ldquo;I might have guessed it. That&rsquo;s a fitting crown
      to the rest of the story. If you have seen an execution, how can you say
      you lived happily all the while?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But is there capital punishment where you were?&rdquo; asked Adelaida.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw it at Lyons. Schneider took us there, and as soon as we arrived we
      came in for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and did you like it very much? Was it very edifying and
      instructive?&rdquo; asked Aglaya.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t like it at all, and was ill after seeing it; but I confess I
      stared as though my eyes were fixed to the sight. I could not tear them
      away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, too, should have been unable to tear my eyes away,&rdquo; said Aglaya.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They do not at all approve of women going to see an execution there. The
      women who do go are condemned for it afterwards in the newspapers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is, by contending that it is not a sight for women they admit that
      it is a sight for men. I congratulate them on the deduction. I suppose you
      quite agree with them, prince?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell us about the execution,&rdquo; put in Adelaida.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would much rather not, just now,&rdquo; said the prince, a little disturbed
      and frowning slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem to want to tell us,&rdquo; said Aglaya, with a mocking air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&mdash;the thing is, I was telling all about the execution a little
      while ago, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom did you tell about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man-servant, while I was waiting to see the general.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our man-servant?&rdquo; exclaimed several voices at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the one who waits in the entrance hall, a greyish, red-faced man&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The prince is clearly a democrat,&rdquo; remarked Aglaya.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if you could tell Aleksey about it, surely you can tell us too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do so want to hear about it,&rdquo; repeated Adelaida.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just now, I confess,&rdquo; began the prince, with more animation, &ldquo;when you
      asked me for a subject for a picture, I confess I had serious thoughts of
      giving you one. I thought of asking you to draw the face of a criminal,
      one minute before the fall of the guillotine, while the wretched man is
      still standing on the scaffold, preparatory to placing his neck on the
      block.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, his face? only his face?&rdquo; asked Adelaida. &ldquo;That would be a strange
      subject indeed. And what sort of a picture would that make?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, why not?&rdquo; the prince insisted, with some warmth. &ldquo;When I was in Basle
      I saw a picture very much in that style&mdash;I should like to tell you
      about it; I will some time or other; it struck me very forcibly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you shall tell us about the Basle picture another time; now we must
      have all about the execution,&rdquo; said Adelaida. &ldquo;Tell us about that face as
      it appeared to your imagination&mdash;how should it be drawn?&mdash;just the
      face alone, do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was just a minute before the execution,&rdquo; began the prince, readily,
      carried away by the recollection and evidently forgetting everything else
      in a moment; &ldquo;just at the instant when he stepped off the ladder on to the
      scaffold. He happened to look in my direction: I saw his eyes and
      understood all, at once&mdash;but how am I to describe it? I do so wish
      you or somebody else could draw it, you, if possible. I thought at the
      time what a picture it would make. You must imagine all that went before,
      of course, all&mdash;all. He had lived in the prison for some time and had
      not expected that the execution would take place for at least a week yet&mdash;he
      had counted on all the formalities and so on taking time; but it so
      happened that his papers had been got ready quickly. At five o&rsquo;clock in
      the morning he was asleep&mdash;it was October, and at five in the morning
      it was cold and dark. The governor of the prison comes in on tip-toe and
      touches the sleeping man&rsquo;s shoulder gently. He starts up. &lsquo;What is it?&rsquo; he
      says. &lsquo;The execution is fixed for ten o&rsquo;clock.&rsquo; He was only just awake,
      and would not believe at first, but began to argue that his papers would
      not be out for a week, and so on. When he was wide awake and realized the
      truth, he became very silent and argued no more&mdash;so they say; but
      after a bit he said: &lsquo;It comes very hard on one so suddenly&rsquo; and then he
      was silent again and said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The three or four hours went by, of course, in necessary preparations&mdash;the
      priest, breakfast, (coffee, meat, and some wine they gave him; doesn&rsquo;t it
      seem ridiculous?) And yet I believe these people give them a good
      breakfast out of pure kindness of heart, and believe that they are doing a
      good action. Then he is dressed, and then begins the procession through
      the town to the scaffold. I think he, too, must feel that he has an age to
      live still while they cart him along. Probably he thought, on the way,
      &lsquo;Oh, I have a long, long time yet. Three streets of life yet! When we&rsquo;ve
      passed this street there&rsquo;ll be that other one; and then that one where the
      baker&rsquo;s shop is on the right; and when shall we get there? It&rsquo;s ages,
      ages!&rsquo; Around him are crowds shouting, yelling&mdash;ten thousand faces,
      twenty thousand eyes. All this has to be endured, and especially the
      thought: &lsquo;Here are ten thousand men, and not one of them is going to be
      executed, and yet I am to die.&rsquo; Well, all that is preparatory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the scaffold there is a ladder, and just there he burst into tears&mdash;and
      this was a strong man, and a terribly wicked one, they say! There was a
      priest with him the whole time, talking; even in the cart as they drove
      along, he talked and talked. Probably the other heard nothing; he would
      begin to listen now and then, and at the third word or so he had forgotten
      all about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last he began to mount the steps; his legs were tied, so that he had
      to take very small steps. The priest, who seemed to be a wise man, had
      stopped talking now, and only held the cross for the wretched fellow to
      kiss. At the foot of the ladder he had been pale enough; but when he set
      foot on the scaffold at the top, his face suddenly became the colour of
      paper, positively like white notepaper. His legs must have become suddenly
      feeble and helpless, and he felt a choking in his throat&mdash;you know
      the sudden feeling one has in moments of terrible fear, when one does not
      lose one&rsquo;s wits, but is absolutely powerless to move? If some dreadful
      thing were suddenly to happen; if a house were just about to fall on one;&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      you know how one would long to sit down and shut one&rsquo;s eyes and wait, and
      wait? Well, when this terrible feeling came over him, the priest quickly
      pressed the cross to his lips, without a word&mdash;a little silver cross
      it was&mdash;and he kept on pressing it to the man&rsquo;s lips every second.
      And whenever the cross touched his lips, the eyes would open for a moment,
      and the legs moved once, and he kissed the cross greedily, hurriedly&mdash;just
      as though he were anxious to catch hold of something in case of its being
      useful to him afterwards, though he could hardly have had any connected
      religious thoughts at the time. And so up to the very block.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How strange that criminals seldom swoon at such a moment! On the
      contrary, the brain is especially active, and works incessantly&mdash;probably
      hard, hard, hard&mdash;like an engine at full pressure. I imagine that
      various thoughts must beat loud and fast through his head&mdash;all
      unfinished ones, and strange, funny thoughts, very likely!&mdash;like
      this, for instance: &lsquo;That man is looking at me, and he has a wart on his
      forehead! and the executioner has burst one of his buttons, and the lowest
      one is all rusty!&rsquo; And meanwhile he notices and remembers everything.
      There is one point that cannot be forgotten, round which everything else
      dances and turns about; and because of this point he cannot faint, and
      this lasts until the very final quarter of a second, when the wretched
      neck is on the block and the victim listens and waits and <i>knows</i>&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      the point, he <i>knows</i> that he is just <i>now</i> about to die, and
      listens for the rasp of the iron over his head. If I lay there, I should
      certainly listen for that grating sound, and hear it, too! There would
      probably be but the tenth part of an instant left to hear it in, but one
      would certainly hear it. And imagine, some people declare that when the
      head flies off it is <i>conscious</i> of having flown off! Just imagine
      what a thing to realize! Fancy if consciousness were to last for even five
      seconds!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Draw the scaffold so that only the top step of the ladder comes in
      clearly. The criminal must be just stepping on to it, his face as white as
      note-paper. The priest is holding the cross to his blue lips, and the
      criminal kisses it, and knows and sees and understands everything. The
      cross and the head&mdash;there&rsquo;s your picture; the priest and the
      executioner, with his two assistants, and a few heads and eyes below.
      Those might come in as subordinate accessories&mdash;a sort of mist.
      There&rsquo;s a picture for you.&rdquo; The prince paused, and looked around.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly that isn&rsquo;t much like quietism,&rdquo; murmured Alexandra, half to
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now tell us about your love affairs,&rdquo; said Adelaida, after a moment&rsquo;s
      pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince gazed at her in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know,&rdquo; Adelaida continued, &ldquo;you owe us a description of the Basle
      picture; but first I wish to hear how you fell in love. Don&rsquo;t deny the
      fact, for you did, of course. Besides, you stop philosophizing when you
      are telling about anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why are you ashamed of your stories the moment after you have told them?&rdquo;
       asked Aglaya, suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How silly you are!&rdquo; said Mrs. Epanchin, looking indignantly towards the
      last speaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that wasn&rsquo;t a clever remark,&rdquo; said Alexandra.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t listen to her, prince,&rdquo; said Mrs. Epanchin; &ldquo;she says that sort of
      thing out of mischief. Don&rsquo;t think anything of their nonsense, it means
      nothing. They love to chaff, but they like you. I can see it in their
      faces&mdash;I know their faces.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know their faces, too,&rdquo; said the prince, with a peculiar stress on the
      words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so?&rdquo; asked Adelaida, with curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do <i>you</i> know about our faces?&rdquo; exclaimed the other two, in
      chorus.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the prince was silent and serious. All awaited his reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you afterwards,&rdquo; he said quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you want to arouse our curiosity!&rdquo; said Aglaya. &ldquo;And how terribly
      solemn you are about it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; interrupted Adelaida, &ldquo;then if you can read faces so well,
      you <i>must</i> have been in love. Come now; I&rsquo;ve guessed&mdash;let&rsquo;s have
      the secret!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not been in love,&rdquo; said the prince, as quietly and seriously as
      before. &ldquo;I have been happy in another way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How, how?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; said the prince, apparently in a deep reverie.
    </p>
    <h3>
      VI.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here you all are,&rdquo; began the prince, &ldquo;settling yourselves down to listen
      to me with so much curiosity, that if I do not satisfy you you will
      probably be angry with me. No, no! I&rsquo;m only joking!&rdquo; he added, hastily,
      with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then&mdash;they were all children there, and I was always among
      children and only with children. They were the children of the village in
      which I lived, and they went to the school there&mdash;all of them. I did
      not teach them, oh no; there was a master for that, one Jules Thibaut. I
      may have taught them some things, but I was among them just as an
      outsider, and I passed all four years of my life there among them. I
      wished for nothing better; I used to tell them everything and hid nothing
      from them. Their fathers and relations were very angry with me, because
      the children could do nothing without me at last, and used to throng after
      me at all times. The schoolmaster was my greatest enemy in the end! I had
      many enemies, and all because of the children. Even Schneider reproached
      me. What were they afraid of? One can tell a child everything, anything. I
      have often been struck by the fact that parents know their children so
      little. They should not conceal so much from them. How well even little
      children understand that their parents conceal things from them, because
      they consider them too young to understand! Children are capable of giving
      advice in the most important matters. How can one deceive these dear
      little birds, when they look at one so sweetly and confidingly? I call
      them birds because there is nothing in the world better than birds!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However, most of the people were angry with me about one and the same
      thing; but Thibaut simply was jealous of me. At first he had wagged his
      head and wondered how it was that the children understood what I told them
      so well, and could not learn from him; and he laughed like anything when I
      replied that neither he nor I could teach them very much, but that <i>they</i>
      might teach us a good deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How he could hate me and tell scandalous stories about me, living among
      children as he did, is what I cannot understand. Children soothe and heal
      the wounded heart. I remember there was one poor fellow at our professor&rsquo;s
      who was being treated for madness, and you have no idea what those
      children did for him, eventually. I don&rsquo;t think he was mad, but only
      terribly unhappy. But I&rsquo;ll tell you all about him another day. Now I must
      get on with this story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The children did not love me at first; I was such a sickly, awkward kind
      of a fellow then&mdash;and I know I am ugly. Besides, I was a foreigner.
      The children used to laugh at me, at first; and they even went so far as
      to throw stones at me, when they saw me kiss Marie. I only kissed her once
      in my life&mdash;no, no, don&rsquo;t laugh!&rdquo; The prince hastened to suppress the
      smiles of his audience at this point. &ldquo;It was not a matter of <i>love</i>
      at all! If only you knew what a miserable creature she was, you would have
      pitied her, just as I did. She belonged to our village. Her mother was an
      old, old woman, and they used to sell string and thread, and soap and
      tobacco, out of the window of their little house, and lived on the
      pittance they gained by this trade. The old woman was ill and very old,
      and could hardly move. Marie was her daughter, a girl of twenty, weak and
      thin and consumptive; but still she did heavy work at the houses around,
      day by day. Well, one fine day a commercial traveller betrayed her and
      carried her off; and a week later he deserted her. She came home dirty,
      draggled, and shoeless; she had walked for a whole week without shoes; she
      had slept in the fields, and caught a terrible cold; her feet were swollen
      and sore, and her hands torn and scratched all over. She never had been
      pretty even before; but her eyes were quiet, innocent, kind eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was very quiet always&mdash;and I remember once, when she had
      suddenly begun singing at her work, everyone said, &lsquo;Marie tried to sing
      today!&rsquo; and she got so chaffed that she was silent for ever after. She had
      been treated kindly in the place before; but when she came back now&mdash;ill
      and shunned and miserable&mdash;not one of them all had the slightest
      sympathy for her. Cruel people! Oh, what hazy understandings they have on
      such matters! Her mother was the first to show the way. She received her
      wrathfully, unkindly, and with contempt. &lsquo;You have disgraced me,&rsquo; she
      said. She was the first to cast her into ignominy; but when they all heard
      that Marie had returned to the village, they ran out to see her and
      crowded into the little cottage&mdash;old men, children, women, girls&mdash;such
      a hurrying, stamping, greedy crowd. Marie was lying on the floor at the
      old woman&rsquo;s feet, hungry, torn, draggled, crying, miserable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When everyone crowded into the room she hid her face in her dishevelled
      hair and lay cowering on the floor. Everyone looked at her as though she
      were a piece of dirt off the road. The old men scolded and condemned, and
      the young ones laughed at her. The women condemned her too, and looked at
      her contemptuously, just as though she were some loathsome insect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her mother allowed all this to go on, and nodded her head and encouraged
      them. The old woman was very ill at that time, and knew she was dying (she
      really did die a couple of months later), and though she felt the end
      approaching she never thought of forgiving her daughter, to the very day
      of her death. She would not even speak to her. She made her sleep on straw
      in a shed, and hardly gave her food enough to support life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marie was very gentle to her mother, and nursed her, and did everything
      for her; but the old woman accepted all her services without a word and
      never showed her the slightest kindness. Marie bore all this; and I could
      see when I got to know her that she thought it quite right and fitting,
      considering herself the lowest and meanest of creatures.

    <p>
      &ldquo;When the old woman took to her bed finally, the other old women in the
      village sat with her by turns, as the custom is there; and then Marie was
      quite driven out of the house. They gave her no food at all, and she could
      not get any work in the village; none would employ her. The men seemed to
      consider her no longer a woman, they said such dreadful things to her.
      Sometimes on Sundays, if they were drunk enough, they used to throw her a
      penny or two, into the mud, and Marie would silently pick up the money.
      She had began to spit blood at that time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last her rags became so tattered and torn that she was ashamed of
      appearing in the village any longer. The children used to pelt her with
      mud; so she begged to be taken on as assistant cowherd, but the cowherd
      would not have her. Then she took to helping him without leave; and he saw
      how valuable her assistance was to him, and did not drive her away again;
      on the contrary, he occasionally gave her the remnants of his dinner,
      bread and cheese. He considered that he was being very kind. When the
      mother died, the village parson was not ashamed to hold Marie up to public
      derision and shame. Marie was standing at the coffin&rsquo;s head, in all her
      rags, crying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A crowd of people had collected to see how she would cry. The parson, a
      young fellow ambitious of becoming a great preacher, began his sermon and
      pointed to Marie. &lsquo;There,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;there is the cause of the death of
      this venerable woman&rsquo;&mdash;(which was a lie, because she had been ill for
      at least two years)&mdash;&lsquo;there she stands before you, and dares not lift
      her eyes from the ground, because she knows that the finger of God is upon
      her. Look at her tatters and rags&mdash;the badge of those who lose their
      virtue. Who is she? her daughter!&rsquo; and so on to the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And just fancy, this infamy pleased them, all of them, nearly. Only the
      children had altered&mdash;for then they were all on my side and had
      learned to love Marie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is how it was: I had wished to do something for Marie; I longed to
      give her some money, but I never had a farthing while I was there. But I
      had a little diamond pin, and this I sold to a travelling pedlar; he gave
      me eight francs for it&mdash;it was worth at least forty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I long sought to meet Marie alone; and at last I did meet her, on the
      hillside beyond the village. I gave her the eight francs and asked her to
      take care of the money because I could get no more; and then I kissed her
      and said that she was not to suppose I kissed her with any evil motives or
      because I was in love with her, for that I did so solely out of pity for
      her, and because from the first I had not accounted her as guilty so much
      as unfortunate. I longed to console and encourage her somehow, and to
      assure her that she was not the low, base thing which she and others
      strove to make out; but I don&rsquo;t think she understood me. She stood before
      me, dreadfully ashamed of herself, and with downcast eyes; and when I had
      finished she kissed my hand. I would have kissed hers, but she drew it
      away. Just at this moment the whole troop of children saw us. (I found out
      afterwards that they had long kept a watch upon me.) They all began
      whistling and clapping their hands, and laughing at us. Marie ran away at
      once; and when I tried to talk to them, they threw stones at me. All the
      village heard of it the same day, and Marie&rsquo;s position became worse than
      ever. The children would not let her pass now in the streets, but annoyed
      her and threw dirt at her more than before. They used to run after her&mdash;she
      racing away with her poor feeble lungs panting and gasping, and they
      pelting her and shouting abuse at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once I had to interfere by force; and after that I took to speaking to
      them every day and whenever I could. Occasionally they stopped and
      listened; but they teased Marie all the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told them how unhappy Marie was, and after a while they stopped their
      abuse of her, and let her go by silently. Little by little we got into the
      way of conversing together, the children and I. I concealed nothing from
      them, I told them all. They listened very attentively and soon began to be
      sorry for Marie. At last some of them took to saying &lsquo;Good-morning&rsquo; to
      her, kindly, when they met her. It is the custom there to salute anyone
      you meet with &lsquo;Good-morning&rsquo; whether acquainted or not. I can imagine how
      astonished Marie was at these first greetings from the children.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once two little girls got hold of some food and took it to her, and came
      back and told me. They said she had burst into tears, and that they loved
      her very much now. Very soon after that they all became fond of Marie, and
      at the same time they began to develop the greatest affection for myself.
      They often came to me and begged me to tell them stories. I think I must
      have told stories well, for they did so love to hear them. At last I took
      to reading up interesting things on purpose to pass them on to the little
      ones, and this went on for all the rest of my time there, three years.
      Later, when everyone&mdash;even Schneider&mdash;was angry with me for
      hiding nothing from the children, I pointed out how foolish it was, for
      they always knew things, only they learnt them in a way that soiled their
      minds but not so from me. One has only to remember one&rsquo;s own childhood to
      admit the truth of this. But nobody was convinced... It was two weeks
      before her mother died that I had kissed Marie; and when the clergyman
      preached that sermon the children were all on my side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I told them what a shame it was of the parson to talk as he had
      done, and explained my reason, they were so angry that some of them went
      and broke his windows with stones. Of course I stopped them, for that was
      not right, but all the village heard of it, and how I caught it for
      spoiling the children! Everyone discovered now that the little ones had
      taken to being fond of Marie, and their parents were terribly alarmed; but
      Marie was so happy. The children were forbidden to meet her; but they used
      to run out of the village to the herd and take her food and things; and
      sometimes just ran off there and kissed her, and said, &lsquo;<i>Je vous aime,
      Marie!</i>&rsquo; and then trotted back again. They imagined that I was in love
      with Marie, and this was the only point on which I did not undeceive them,
      for they got such enjoyment out of it. And what delicacy and tenderness
      they showed!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the evening I used to walk to the waterfall. There was a spot there
      which was quite closed in and hidden from view by large trees; and to this
      spot the children used to come to me. They could not bear that their dear
      Leon should love a poor girl without shoes to her feet and dressed all in
      rags and tatters. So, would you believe it, they actually clubbed
      together, somehow, and bought her shoes and stockings, and some linen, and
      even a dress! I can&rsquo;t understand how they managed it, but they did it, all
      together. When I asked them about it they only laughed and shouted, and
      the little girls clapped their hands and kissed me. I sometimes went to
      see Marie secretly, too. She had become very ill, and could hardly walk.
      She still went with the herd, but could not help the herdsman any longer.
      She used to sit on a stone near, and wait there almost motionless all day,
      till the herd went home. Her consumption was so advanced, and she was so
      weak, that she used to sit with closed eyes, breathing heavily. Her face
      was as thin as a skeleton&rsquo;s, and sweat used to stand on her white brow in
      large drops. I always found her sitting just like that. I used to come up
      quietly to look at her; but Marie would hear me, open her eyes, and
      tremble violently as she kissed my hands. I did not take my hand away
      because it made her happy to have it, and so she would sit and cry
      quietly. Sometimes she tried to speak; but it was very difficult to
      understand her. She was almost like a madwoman, with excitement and
      ecstasy, whenever I came. Occasionally the children came with me; when
      they did so, they would stand some way off and keep guard over us, so as
      to tell me if anybody came near. This was a great pleasure to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When we left her, Marie used to relapse at once into her old condition,
      and sit with closed eyes and motionless limbs. One day she could not go
      out at all, and remained at home all alone in the empty hut; but the
      children very soon became aware of the fact, and nearly all of them
      visited her that day as she lay alone and helpless in her miserable bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For two days the children looked after her, and then, when the village
      people got to know that Marie was really dying, some of the old women came
      and took it in turns to sit by her and look after her a bit. I think they
      began to be a little sorry for her in the village at last; at all events
      they did not interfere with the children any more, on her account.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marie lay in a state of uncomfortable delirium the whole while; she
      coughed dreadfully. The old women would not let the children stay in the
      room; but they all collected outside the window each morning, if only for
      a moment, and shouted &lsquo;<i>Bon jour, notre bonne Marie!</i>&rsquo; and Marie no
      sooner caught sight of, or heard them, and she became quite animated at
      once, and, in spite of the old women, would try to sit up and nod her head
      and smile at them, and thank them. The little ones used to bring her nice
      things and sweets to eat, but she could hardly touch anything. Thanks to
      them, I assure you, the girl died almost perfectly happy. She almost
      forgot her misery, and seemed to accept their love as a sort of symbol of
      pardon for her offence, though she never ceased to consider herself a
      dreadful sinner. They used to flutter at her window just like little
      birds, calling out: &lsquo;<i>Nous t&rsquo;aimons, Marie!</i>&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She died very soon; I had thought she would live much longer. The day
      before her death I went to see her for the last time, just before sunset.
      I think she recognized me, for she pressed my hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Next morning they came and told me that Marie was dead. The children
      could not be restrained now; they went and covered her coffin with
      flowers, and put a wreath of lovely blossoms on her head. The pastor did
      not throw any more shameful words at the poor dead woman; but there were
      very few people at the funeral. However, when it came to carrying the
      coffin, all the children rushed up, to carry it themselves. Of course they
      could not do it alone, but they insisted on helping, and walked alongside
      and behind, crying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have planted roses all round her grave, and every year they look
      after the flowers and make Marie&rsquo;s resting-place as beautiful as they can.
      I was in ill odour after all this with the parents of the children, and
      especially with the parson and schoolmaster. Schneider was obliged to
      promise that I should not meet them and talk to them; but we conversed
      from a distance by signs, and they used to write me sweet little notes.
      Afterwards I came closer than ever to those little souls, but even then it
      was very dear to me, to have them so fond of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Schneider said that I did the children great harm by my pernicious
      &lsquo;system&rsquo;; what nonsense that was! And what did he mean by my system? He
      said afterwards that he believed I was a child myself&mdash;just before I
      came away. &lsquo;You have the form and face of an adult&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;but as
      regards soul, and character, and perhaps even intelligence, you are a
      child in the completest sense of the word, and always will be, if you live
      to be sixty.&rsquo; I laughed very much, for of course that is nonsense. But it
      is a fact that I do not care to be among grown-up people and much prefer
      the society of children. However kind people may be to me, I never feel
      quite at home with them, and am always glad to get back to my little
      companions. Now my companions have always been children, not because I was
      a child myself once, but because young things attract me. On one of the
      first days of my stay in Switzerland, I was strolling about alone and
      miserable, when I came upon the children rushing noisily out of school,
      with their slates and bags, and books, their games, their laughter and
      shouts&mdash;and my soul went out to them. I stopped and laughed happily
      as I watched their little feet moving so quickly. Girls and boys, laughing
      and crying; for as they went home many of them found time to fight and
      make peace, to weep and play. I forgot my troubles in looking at them. And
      then, all those three years, I tried to understand why men should be for
      ever tormenting themselves. I lived the life of a child there, and thought
      I should never leave the little village; indeed, I was far from thinking
      that I should ever return to Russia. But at last I recognized the fact
      that Schneider could not keep me any longer. And then something so
      important happened, that Schneider himself urged me to depart. I am going
      to see now if can get good advice about it. Perhaps my lot in life will be
      changed; but that is not the principal thing. The principal thing is the
      entire change that has already come over me. I left many things behind me&mdash;too
      many. They have gone. On the journey I said to myself, &lsquo;I am going into
      the world of men. I don&rsquo;t know much, perhaps, but a new life has begun for
      me.&rsquo; I made up my mind to be honest, and steadfast in accomplishing my
      task. Perhaps I shall meet with troubles and many disappointments, but I
      have made up my mind to be polite and sincere to everyone; more cannot be
      asked of me. People may consider me a child if they like. I am often
      called an idiot, and at one time I certainly was so ill that I was nearly
      as bad as an idiot; but I am not an idiot now. How can I possibly be so
      when I know myself that I am considered one?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I received a letter from those dear little souls, while passing
      through Berlin, I only then realized how much I loved them. It was very,
      very painful, getting that first little letter. How melancholy they had
      been when they saw me off! For a month before, they had been talking of my
      departure and sorrowing over it; and at the waterfall, of an evening, when
      we parted for the night, they would hug me so tight and kiss me so warmly,
      far more so than before. And every now and then they would turn up one by
      one when I was alone, just to give me a kiss and a hug, to show their love
      for me. The whole flock went with me to the station, which was about a
      mile from the village, and every now and then one of them would stop to
      throw his arms round me, and all the little girls had tears in their
      voices, though they tried hard not to cry. As the train steamed out of the
      station, I saw them all standing on the platform waving to me and crying
      &lsquo;Hurrah!&rsquo; till they were lost in the distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you, when I came in here just now and saw your kind faces (I can
      read faces well) my heart felt light for the first time since that moment
      of parting. I think I must be one of those who are born to be in luck, for
      one does not often meet with people whom one feels he can love from the
      first sight of their faces; and yet, no sooner do I step out of the
      railway carriage than I happen upon you!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it is more or less a shamefaced thing to speak of one&rsquo;s feelings
      before others; and yet here am I talking like this to you, and am not a
      bit ashamed or shy. I am an unsociable sort of fellow and shall very
      likely not come to see you again for some time; but don&rsquo;t think the worse
      of me for that. It is not that I do not value your society; and you must
      never suppose that I have taken offence at anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You asked me about your faces, and what I could read in them; I will tell
      you with the greatest pleasure. You, Adelaida Ivanovna, have a very happy
      face; it is the most sympathetic of the three. Not to speak of your
      natural beauty, one can look at your face and say to one&rsquo;s self, &lsquo;She has
      the face of a kind sister.&rsquo; You are simple and merry, but you can see into
      another&rsquo;s heart very quickly. That&rsquo;s what I read in your face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You too, Alexandra Ivanovna, have a very lovely face; but I think you may
      have some secret sorrow. Your heart is undoubtedly a kind, good one, but
      you are not merry. There is a certain suspicion of &lsquo;shadow&rsquo; in your face,
      like in that of Holbein&rsquo;s Madonna in Dresden. So much for your face. Have
      I guessed right?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for your face, Lizabetha Prokofievna, I not only think, but am
      perfectly <i>sure</i>, that you are an absolute child&mdash;in all, in
      all, mind, both good and bad&mdash;and in spite of your years. Don&rsquo;t be
      angry with me for saying so; you know what my feelings for children are.
      And do not suppose that I am so candid out of pure simplicity of soul. Oh
      dear no, it is by no means the case! Perhaps I have my own very profound
      object in view.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <h3>
      VII.
    </h3>
    <p>
      When the prince ceased speaking all were gazing merrily at him&mdash;even
      Aglaya; but Lizabetha Prokofievna looked the jolliest of all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;we <i>have</i> &lsquo;put him through his paces,&rsquo; with a
      vengeance! My dears, you imagined, I believe, that you were about to
      patronize this young gentleman, like some poor <i>protégé</i> picked up
      somewhere, and taken under your magnificent protection. What fools we
      were, and what a specially big fool is your father! Well done, prince! I
      assure you the general actually asked me to put you through your paces,
      and examine you. As to what you said about my face, you are absolutely
      correct in your judgment. I am a child, and know it. I knew it long before
      you said so; you have expressed my own thoughts. I think your nature and
      mine must be extremely alike, and I am very glad of it. We are like two
      drops of water, only you are a man and I a woman, and I&rsquo;ve not been to
      Switzerland, and that is all the difference between us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be in a hurry, mother; the prince says that he has some motive
      behind his simplicity,&rdquo; cried Aglaya.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, so he does,&rdquo; laughed the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t you begin bantering him,&rdquo; said mamma. &ldquo;He is probably a good
      deal cleverer than all three of you girls put together. We shall see. Only
      you haven&rsquo;t told us anything about Aglaya yet, prince; and Aglaya and I
      are both waiting to hear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot say anything at present. I&rsquo;ll tell you afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? Her face is clear enough, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, of course. You are very beautiful, Aglaya Ivanovna, so beautiful
      that one is afraid to look at you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all? What about her character?&rdquo; persisted Mrs. Epanchin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is difficult to judge when such beauty is concerned. I have not
      prepared my judgment. Beauty is a riddle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That means that you have set Aglaya a riddle!&rdquo; said Adelaida. &ldquo;Guess it,
      Aglaya! But she&rsquo;s pretty, prince, isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most wonderfully so,&rdquo; said the latter, warmly, gazing at Aglaya with
      admiration. &ldquo;Almost as lovely as Nastasia Philipovna, but quite a
      different type.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All present exchanged looks of surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As lovely as <i>who?</i>&rdquo; said Mrs. Epanchin. &ldquo;As <i>Nastasia Philipovna?</i>
      Where have you seen Nastasia Philipovna? What Nastasia Philipovna?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gavrila Ardalionovitch showed the general her portrait just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so? Did he bring the portrait for my husband?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only to show it. Nastasia Philipovna gave it to Gavrila Ardalionovitch
      today, and the latter brought it here to show to the general.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must see it!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Epanchin. &ldquo;Where is the portrait? If she gave
      it to him, he must have it; and he is still in the study. He never leaves
      before four o&rsquo;clock on Wednesdays. Send for Gavrila Ardalionovitch at
      once. No, I don&rsquo;t long to see <i>him</i> so much. Look here, dear prince,
      <i>be</i> so kind, will you? Just step to the study and fetch this
      portrait! Say we want to look at it. Please do this for me, will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a nice fellow, but a little too simple,&rdquo; said Adelaida, as the
      prince left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is, indeed,&rdquo; said Alexandra; &ldquo;almost laughably so at times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Neither one nor the other seemed to give expression to her full thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He got out of it very neatly about our faces, though,&rdquo; said Aglaya. &ldquo;He
      flattered us all round, even mamma.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; cried the latter. &ldquo;He did not flatter me. It was I who found
      his appreciation flattering. I think you are a great deal more foolish
      than he is. He is simple, of course, but also very knowing. Just like
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How stupid of me to speak of the portrait,&rdquo; thought the prince as he
      entered the study, with a feeling of guilt at his heart, &ldquo;and yet, perhaps
      I was right after all.&rdquo; He had an idea, unformed as yet, but a strange
      idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gavrila Ardalionovitch was still sitting in the study, buried in a mass of
      papers. He looked as though he did not take his salary from the public
      company, whose servant he was, for a sinecure.
    </p>
    <p>
      He grew very wroth and confused when the prince asked for the portrait,
      and explained how it came about that he had spoken of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, curse it all,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;what on earth must you go blabbing for? You
      know nothing about the thing, and yet&mdash;idiot!&rdquo; he added, muttering
      the last word to himself in irrepressible rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very sorry; I was not thinking at the time. I merely said that
      Aglaya was almost as beautiful as Nastasia Philipovna.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gania asked for further details; and the prince once more repeated the
      conversation. Gania looked at him with ironical contempt the while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nastasia Philipovna,&rdquo; he began, and there paused; he was clearly much
      agitated and annoyed. The prince reminded him of the portrait.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, prince,&rdquo; said Gania, as though an idea had just struck him, &ldquo;I
      wish to ask you a great favour, and yet I really don&rsquo;t know&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused again, he was trying to make up his mind to something, and was
      turning the matter over. The prince waited quietly. Once more Gania fixed
      him with intent and questioning eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prince,&rdquo; he began again, &ldquo;they are rather angry with me, in there, owing
      to a circumstance which I need not explain, so that I do not care to go in
      at present without an invitation. I particularly wish to speak to Aglaya,
      but I have written a few words in case I shall not have the chance of
      seeing her&rdquo; (here the prince observed a small note in his hand), &ldquo;and I do
      not know how to get my communication to her. Don&rsquo;t you think you could
      undertake to give it to her at once, but only to her, mind, and so that no
      one else should see you give it? It isn&rsquo;t much of a secret, but still&mdash;Well,
      will you do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite like it,&rdquo; replied the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but it is absolutely necessary for me,&rdquo; Gania entreated. &ldquo;Believe me,
      if it were not so, I would not ask you; how else am I to get it to her? It
      is most important, dreadfully important!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gania was evidently much alarmed at the idea that the prince would not
      consent to take his note, and he looked at him now with an expression of
      absolute entreaty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I will take it then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But mind, nobody is to see!&rdquo; cried the delighted Gania &ldquo;And of course I
      may rely on your word of honour, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t show it to anyone,&rdquo; said the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The letter is not sealed&mdash;&rdquo; continued Gania, and paused in
      confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I won&rsquo;t read it,&rdquo; said the prince, quite simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took up the portrait, and went out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gania, left alone, clutched his head with his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One word from her,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;one word from her, and I may yet be free.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He could not settle himself to his papers again, for agitation and
      excitement, but began walking up and down the room from corner to corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince walked along, musing. He did not like his commission, and
      disliked the idea of Gania sending a note to Aglaya at all; but when he
      was two rooms distant from the drawing-room, where they all were, he
      stopped as though recalling something; went to the window, nearer the
      light, and began to examine the portrait in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      He longed to solve the mystery of something in the face of Nastasia
      Philipovna, something which had struck him as he looked at the portrait
      for the first time; the impression had not left him. It was partly the
      fact of her marvellous beauty that struck him, and partly something else.
      There was a suggestion of immense pride and disdain in the face almost of
      hatred, and at the same time something confiding and very full of
      simplicity. The contrast aroused a deep sympathy in his heart as he looked
      at the lovely face. The blinding loveliness of it was almost intolerable,
      this pale thin face with its flaming eyes; it was a strange beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince gazed at it for a minute or two, then glanced around him, and
      hurriedly raised the portrait to his lips. When, a minute after, he
      reached the drawing-room door, his face was quite composed. But just as he
      reached the door he met Aglaya coming out alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gavrila Ardalionovitch begged me to give you this,&rdquo; he said, handing her
      the note.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aglaya stopped, took the letter, and gazed strangely into the prince&rsquo;s
      eyes. There was no confusion in her face; a little surprise, perhaps, but
      that was all. By her look she seemed merely to challenge the prince to an
      explanation as to how he and Gania happened to be connected in this
      matter. But her expression was perfectly cool and quiet, and even
      condescending.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they stood for a moment or two, confronting one another. At length a
      faint smile passed over her face, and she passed by him without a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Epanchin examined the portrait of Nastasia Philipovna for some little
      while, holding it critically at arm&rsquo;s length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she is pretty,&rdquo; she said at last, &ldquo;even very pretty. I have seen her
      twice, but only at a distance. So you admire this kind of beauty, do you?&rdquo;
       she asked the prince, suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do&mdash;this kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean especially this kind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, especially this kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is much suffering in this face,&rdquo; murmured the prince, more as
      though talking to himself than answering the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you are wandering a little, prince,&rdquo; Mrs. Epanchin decided, after
      a lengthened survey of his face; and she tossed the portrait on to the
      table, haughtily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alexandra took it, and Adelaida came up, and both the girls examined the
      photograph. Just then Aglaya entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a power!&rdquo; cried Adelaida suddenly, as she earnestly examined the
      portrait over her sister&rsquo;s shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom? What power?&rdquo; asked her mother, crossly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such beauty is real power,&rdquo; said Adelaida. &ldquo;With such beauty as that one
      might overthrow the world.&rdquo; She returned to her easel thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aglaya merely glanced at the portrait&mdash;frowned, and put out her
      underlip; then went and sat down on the sofa with folded hands. Mrs.
      Epanchin rang the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask Gavrila Ardalionovitch to step this way,&rdquo; said she to the man who
      answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma!&rdquo; cried Alexandra, significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall just say two words to him, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; said her mother,
      silencing all objection by her manner; she was evidently seriously put
      out. &ldquo;You see, prince, it is all secrets with us, just now&mdash;all
      secrets. It seems to be the etiquette of the house, for some reason or
      other. Stupid nonsense, and in a matter which ought to be approached with
      all candour and open-heartedness. There is a marriage being talked of, and
      I don&rsquo;t like this marriage&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma, what are you saying?&rdquo; said Alexandra again, hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what, my dear girl? As if you can possibly like it yourself? The
      heart is the great thing, and the rest is all rubbish&mdash;though one
      must have sense as well. Perhaps sense is really the great thing. Don&rsquo;t
      smile like that, Aglaya. I don&rsquo;t contradict myself. A fool with a heart
      and no brains is just as unhappy as a fool with brains and no heart. I am
      one and you are the other, and therefore both of us suffer, both of us are
      unhappy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why are you so unhappy, mother?&rdquo; asked Adelaida, who alone of all the
      company seemed to have preserved her good temper and spirits up to now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the first place, because of my carefully brought-up daughters,&rdquo; said
      Mrs. Epanchin, cuttingly; &ldquo;and as that is the best reason I can give you
      we need not bother about any other at present. Enough of words, now! We
      shall see how both of you (I don&rsquo;t count Aglaya) will manage your
      business, and whether you, most revered Alexandra Ivanovna, will be happy
      with your fine mate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she added, as Gania suddenly entered the room, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s another
      marrying subject. How do you do?&rdquo; she continued, in response to Gania&rsquo;s
      bow; but she did not invite him to sit down. &ldquo;You are going to be
      married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Married? how&mdash;what marriage?&rdquo; murmured Gania, overwhelmed with
      confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you about to take a wife? I ask,&mdash;if you prefer that
      expression.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no I&mdash;I&mdash;no!&rdquo; said Gania, bringing out his lie with a
      tell-tale blush of shame. He glanced keenly at Aglaya, who was sitting
      some way off, and dropped his eyes immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aglaya gazed coldly, intently, and composedly at him, without taking her
      eyes off his face, and watched his confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No? You say no, do you?&rdquo; continued the pitiless Mrs. General. &ldquo;Very well,
      I shall remember that you told me this Wednesday morning, in answer to my
      question, that you are not going to be married. What day is it, Wednesday,
      isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think so!&rdquo; said Adelaida.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never know the day of the week; what&rsquo;s the day of the month?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty-seventh!&rdquo; said Gania.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty-seventh; very well. Good-bye now; you have a good deal to do, I&rsquo;m
      sure, and I must dress and go out. Take your portrait. Give my respects to
      your unfortunate mother, Nina Alexandrovna. <i>Au revoir</i>, dear prince,
      come in and see us often, do; and I shall tell old Princess Bielokonski
      about you. I shall go and see her on purpose. And listen, my dear boy, I
      feel sure that God has sent you to Petersburg from Switzerland on purpose
      for me. Maybe you will have other things to do, besides, but you are sent
      chiefly for my sake, I feel sure of it. God sent you to me! <i>Au revoir!</i>
      Alexandra, come with me, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Epanchin left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gania&mdash;confused, annoyed, furious&mdash;took up his portrait, and
      turned to the prince with a nasty smile on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prince,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am just going home. If you have not changed your
      mind as to living with us, perhaps you would like to come with me. You
      don&rsquo;t know the address, I believe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a minute, prince,&rdquo; said Aglaya, suddenly rising from her seat, &ldquo;do
      write something in my album first, will you? Father says you are a most
      talented caligraphist; I&rsquo;ll bring you my book in a minute.&rdquo; She left the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, <i>au revoir</i>, prince,&rdquo; said Adelaida, &ldquo;I must be going too.&rdquo;
       She pressed the prince&rsquo;s hand warmly, and gave him a friendly smile as she
      left the room. She did not so much as look at Gania.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is your doing, prince,&rdquo; said Gania, turning on the latter so soon as
      the others were all out of the room. &ldquo;This is your doing, sir! <i>You</i>
      have been telling them that I am going to be married!&rdquo; He said this in a
      hurried whisper, his eyes flashing with rage and his face ablaze. &ldquo;You
      shameless tattler!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you, you are under a delusion,&rdquo; said the prince, calmly and
      politely. &ldquo;I did not even know that you were to be married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You heard me talking about it, the general and me. You heard me say that
      everything was to be settled today at Nastasia Philipovna&rsquo;s, and you went
      and blurted it out here. You lie if you deny it. Who else could have told
      them? Devil take it, sir, who could have told them except yourself? Didn&rsquo;t
      the old woman as good as hint as much to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she hinted to you who told her you must know best, of course; but I
      never said a word about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you give my note? Is there an answer?&rdquo; interrupted Gania,
      impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at this moment Aglaya came back, and the prince had no time to reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, prince,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s my album. Now choose a page and write
      me something, will you? There&rsquo;s a pen, a new one; do you mind a steel one?
      I have heard that you caligraphists don&rsquo;t like steel pens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Conversing with the prince, Aglaya did not even seem to notice that Gania
      was in the room. But while the prince was getting his pen ready, finding a
      page, and making his preparations to write, Gania came up to the fireplace
      where Aglaya was standing, to the right of the prince, and in trembling,
      broken accents said, almost in her ear:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One word, just one word from you, and I&rsquo;m saved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince turned sharply round and looked at both of them. Gania&rsquo;s face
      was full of real despair; he seemed to have said the words almost
      unconsciously and on the impulse of the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aglaya gazed at him for some seconds with precisely the same composure and
      calm astonishment as she had shown a little while before, when the prince
      handed her the note, and it appeared that this calm surprise and seemingly
      absolute incomprehension of what was said to her, were more terribly
      overwhelming to Gania than even the most plainly expressed disdain would
      have been.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall I write?&rdquo; asked the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll dictate to you,&rdquo; said Aglaya, coming up to the table. &ldquo;Now then, are
      you ready? Write, &lsquo;I never condescend to bargain!&rsquo; Now put your name and
      the date. Let me see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince handed her the album.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Capital! How beautifully you have written it! Thanks so much. <i>Au
      revoir</i>, prince. Wait a minute,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;I want to give you
      something for a keepsake. Come with me this way, will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince followed her. Arrived at the dining-room, she stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read this,&rdquo; she said, handing him Gania&rsquo;s note.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince took it from her hand, but gazed at her in bewilderment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I <i>know</i> you haven&rsquo;t read it, and that you could never be that
      man&rsquo;s accomplice. Read it, I wish you to read it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The letter had evidently been written in a hurry:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My fate is to be decided today&rdquo; (it ran), &ldquo;you know how. This day I
        must give my word irrevocably. I have no right to ask your help, and I
        dare not allow myself to indulge in any hopes; but once you said just
        one word, and that word lighted up the night of my life, and became the
        beacon of my days. Say one more such word, and save me from utter ruin.
        Only tell me, &lsquo;break off the whole thing!&rsquo; and I will do so this very
        day. Oh! what can it cost you to say just this one word? In doing so you
        will but be giving me a sign of your sympathy for me, and of your pity;
        only this, only this; nothing more, <i>nothing</i>. I dare not indulge
        in any hope, because I am unworthy of it. But if you say but this word,
        I will take up my cross again with joy, and return once more to my
        battle with poverty. I shall meet the storm and be glad of it; I shall
        rise up with renewed strength.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Send me back then this one word of sympathy, only sympathy, I swear to
        you; and oh! do not be angry with the audacity of despair, with the
        drowning man who has dared to make this last effort to save himself from
        perishing beneath the waters.
      </p>
      <p class="sig">
        &ldquo;G.L.&rdquo;
       </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This man assures me,&rdquo; said Aglaya, scornfully, when the prince had
      finished reading the letter, &ldquo;that the words &lsquo;break off everything&rsquo; do not
      commit me to anything whatever; and himself gives me a written guarantee
      to that effect, in this letter. Observe how ingenuously he underlines
      certain words, and how crudely he glosses over his hidden thoughts. He
      must know that if he &lsquo;broke off everything,&rsquo; <i>first</i>, by himself, and
      without telling me a word about it or having the slightest hope on my
      account, that in that case I should perhaps be able to change my opinion
      of him, and even accept his&mdash;friendship. He must know that, but his
      soul is such a wretched thing. He knows it and cannot make up his mind; he
      knows it and yet asks for guarantees. He cannot bring himself to <i>trust</i>,
      he wants me to give him hopes of myself before he lets go of his hundred
      thousand roubles. As to the &lsquo;former word&rsquo; which he declares &lsquo;lighted up
      the night of his life,&rsquo; he is simply an impudent liar; I merely pitied him
      once. But he is audacious and shameless. He immediately began to hope, at
      that very moment. I saw it. He has tried to catch me ever since; he is
      still fishing for me. Well, enough of this. Take the letter and give it
      back to him, as soon as you have left our house; not before, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what shall I tell him by way of answer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing&mdash;of course! That&rsquo;s the best answer. Is it the case that you
      are going to live in his house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, your father kindly recommended me to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then look out for him, I warn you! He won&rsquo;t forgive you easily, for
      taking back the letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aglaya pressed the prince&rsquo;s hand and left the room. Her face was serious
      and frowning; she did not even smile as she nodded good-bye to him at the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just get my parcel and we&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; said the prince to Gania, as he
      re-entered the drawing-room. Gania stamped his foot with impatience. His
      face looked dark and gloomy with rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last they left the house behind them, the prince carrying his bundle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The answer&mdash;quick&mdash;the answer!&rdquo; said Gania, the instant they
      were outside. &ldquo;What did she say? Did you give the letter?&rdquo; The prince
      silently held out the note. Gania was struck motionless with amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How, what? my letter?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;He never delivered it! I might have
      guessed it, oh! curse him! Of course she did not understand what I meant,
      naturally! Why&mdash;why&mdash;<i>why</i> didn&rsquo;t you give her the note,
      you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me; I was able to deliver it almost immediately after receiving
      your commission, and I gave it, too, just as you asked me to. It has come
      into my hands now because Aglaya Ivanovna has just returned it to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How? When?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As soon as I finished writing in her album for her, and when she asked me
      to come out of the room with her (you heard?), we went into the
      dining-room, and she gave me your letter to read, and then told me to
      return it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To <i>read?</i>&rdquo; cried Gania, almost at the top of his voice; &ldquo;to <i>read</i>,
      and you read it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And again he stood like a log in the middle of the pavement; so amazed
      that his mouth remained open after the last word had left it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have just read it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she gave it you to read herself&mdash;<i>herself?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, herself; and you may believe me when I tell you that I would not
      have read it for anything without her permission.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gania was silent for a minute or two, as though thinking out some problem.
      Suddenly he cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s impossible, she cannot have given it to you to read! You are lying.
      You read it yourself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am telling you the truth,&rdquo; said the prince in his former composed tone
      of voice; &ldquo;and believe me, I am extremely sorry that the circumstance
      should have made such an unpleasant impression upon you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, you wretched man, at least she must have said something? There must
      be <i>some</i> answer from her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of course, she did say something!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out with it then, damn it! Out with it at once!&rdquo; and Gania stamped his
      foot twice on the pavement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As soon as I had finished reading it, she told me that you were fishing
      for her; that you wished to compromise her so far as to receive some hopes
      from her, trusting to which hopes you might break with the prospect of
      receiving a hundred thousand roubles. She said that if you had done this
      without bargaining with her, if you had broken with the money prospects
      without trying to force a guarantee out of her first, she might have been
      your friend. That&rsquo;s all, I think. Oh no, when I asked her what I was to
      say, as I took the letter, she replied that &lsquo;no answer is the best
      answer.&rsquo; I think that was it. Forgive me if I do not use her exact
      expressions. I tell you the sense as I understood it myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ungovernable rage and madness took entire possession of Gania, and his
      fury burst out without the least attempt at restraint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! that&rsquo;s it, is it!&rdquo; he yelled. &ldquo;She throws my letters out of the
      window, does she! Oh! and she does not condescend to bargain, while I <i>do</i>,
      eh? We shall see, we shall see! I shall pay her out for this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He twisted himself about with rage, and grew paler and paler; he shook his
      fist. So the pair walked along a few steps. Gania did not stand on
      ceremony with the prince; he behaved just as though he were alone in his
      room. He clearly counted the latter as a nonentity. But suddenly he seemed
      to have an idea, and recollected himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how was it?&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;how was it that you (idiot that you are),&rdquo; he
      added to himself, &ldquo;were so very confidential a couple of hours after your
      first meeting with these people? How was that, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Up to this moment jealousy had not been one of his torments; now it
      suddenly gnawed at his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a thing I cannot undertake to explain,&rdquo; replied the prince. Gania
      looked at him with angry contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I suppose the present she wished to make to you, when she took you
      into the dining-room, was her confidence, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose that was it; I cannot explain it otherwise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why, <i>why?</i> Devil take it, what did you do in there? Why did
      they fancy you? Look here, can&rsquo;t you remember exactly what you said to
      them, from the very beginning? Can&rsquo;t you remember?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we talked of a great many things. When first I went in we began to
      speak of Switzerland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the devil take Switzerland!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then about executions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Executions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;at least about one. Then I told the whole three years&rsquo; story of
      my life, and the history of a poor peasant girl&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, damn the peasant girl! go on, go on!&rdquo; said Gania, impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then how Schneider told me about my childish nature, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, <i>curse</i> Schneider and his dirty opinions! Go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I began to talk about faces, at least about the <i>expressions</i>
      of faces, and said that Aglaya Ivanovna was nearly as lovely as Nastasia
      Philipovna. It was then I blurted out about the portrait&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you didn&rsquo;t repeat what you heard in the study? You didn&rsquo;t repeat that&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I tell you I did <i>not</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then how did they&mdash;look here! Did Aglaya show my letter to the old
      lady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there I can give you my fullest assurance that she did <i>not</i>. I
      was there all the while&mdash;she had no time to do it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But perhaps you may not have observed it, oh, you damned idiot, you!&rdquo; he
      shouted, quite beside himself with fury. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t even describe what
      went on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gania having once descended to abuse, and receiving no check, very soon
      knew no bounds or limit to his licence, as is often the way in such cases.
      His rage so blinded him that he had not even been able to detect that this
      &ldquo;idiot,&rdquo; whom he was abusing to such an extent, was very far from being
      slow of comprehension, and had a way of taking in an impression, and
      afterwards giving it out again, which was very un-idiotic indeed. But
      something a little unforeseen now occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I ought to tell you, Gavrila Ardalionovitch,&rdquo; said the prince,
      suddenly, &ldquo;that though I once was so ill that I really was little better
      than an idiot, yet now I am almost recovered, and that, therefore, it is
      not altogether pleasant to be called an idiot to my face. Of course your
      anger is excusable, considering the treatment you have just experienced;
      but I must remind you that you have twice abused me rather rudely. I do
      not like this sort of thing, and especially so at the first time of
      meeting a man, and, therefore, as we happen to be at this moment standing
      at a crossroad, don&rsquo;t you think we had better part, you to the left,
      homewards, and I to the right, here? I have twenty-five roubles, and I
      shall easily find a lodging.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gania was much confused, and blushed for shame &ldquo;Do forgive me, prince!&rdquo; he
      cried, suddenly changing his abusive tone for one of great courtesy. &ldquo;For
      Heaven&rsquo;s sake, forgive me! You see what a miserable plight I am in, but
      you hardly know anything of the facts of the case as yet. If you did, I am
      sure you would forgive me, at least partially. Of course it was
      inexcusable of me, I know, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear me, I really do not require such profuse apologies,&rdquo; replied the
      prince, hastily. &ldquo;I quite understand how unpleasant your position is, and
      that is what made you abuse me. So come along to your house, after all. I
      shall be delighted&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not going to let him go like this,&rdquo; thought Gania, glancing angrily
      at the prince as they walked along. &ldquo;The fellow has sucked everything out
      of me, and now he takes off his mask&mdash;there&rsquo;s something more than
      appears, here we shall see. It shall all be as clear as water by tonight,
      everything!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But by this time they had reached Gania&rsquo;s house.
    </p>
    <h3>
      VIII.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The flat occupied by Gania and his family was on the third floor of the
      house. It was reached by a clean light staircase, and consisted of seven
      rooms, a nice enough lodging, and one would have thought a little too good
      for a clerk on two thousand roubles a year. But it was designed to
      accommodate a few lodgers on board terms, and had been taken a few months
      since, much to the disgust of Gania, at the urgent request of his mother
      and his sister, Varvara Ardalionovna, who longed to do something to
      increase the family income a little, and fixed their hopes upon letting
      lodgings. Gania frowned upon the idea. He thought it <i>infra dig</i>, and
      did not quite like appearing in society afterwards&mdash;that society in
      which he had been accustomed to pose up to now as a young man of rather
      brilliant prospects. All these concessions and rebuffs of fortune, of
      late, had wounded his spirit severely, and his temper had become extremely
      irritable, his wrath being generally quite out of proportion to the cause.
      But if he had made up his mind to put up with this sort of life for a
      while, it was only on the plain understanding with his inner self that he
      would very soon change it all, and have things as he chose again. Yet the
      very means by which he hoped to make this change threatened to involve him
      in even greater difficulties than he had had before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The flat was divided by a passage which led straight out of the
      entrance-hall. Along one side of this corridor lay the three rooms which
      were designed for the accommodation of the &ldquo;highly recommended&rdquo; lodgers.
      Besides these three rooms there was another small one at the end of the
      passage, close to the kitchen, which was allotted to General Ivolgin, the
      nominal master of the house, who slept on a wide sofa, and was obliged to
      pass into and out of his room through the kitchen, and up or down the back
      stairs. Colia, Gania&rsquo;s young brother, a school-boy of thirteen, shared
      this room with his father. He, too, had to sleep on an old sofa, a narrow,
      uncomfortable thing with a torn rug over it; his chief duty being to look
      after his father, who needed to be watched more and more every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince was given the middle room of the three, the first being
      occupied by one Ferdishenko, while the third was empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Gania first conducted the prince to the family apartments. These
      consisted of a &ldquo;salon,&rdquo; which became the dining-room when required; a
      drawing-room, which was only a drawing-room in the morning, and became
      Gania&rsquo;s study in the evening, and his bedroom at night; and lastly Nina
      Alexandrovna&rsquo;s and Varvara&rsquo;s bedroom, a small, close chamber which they
      shared together.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a word, the whole place was confined, and a &ldquo;tight fit&rdquo; for the party.
      Gania used to grind his teeth with rage over the state of affairs; though
      he was anxious to be dutiful and polite to his mother. However, it was
      very soon apparent to anyone coming into the house, that Gania was the
      tyrant of the family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nina Alexandrovna and her daughter were both seated in the drawing-room,
      engaged in knitting, and talking to a visitor, Ivan Petrovitch Ptitsin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady of the house appeared to be a woman of about fifty years of age,
      thin-faced, and with black lines under the eyes. She looked ill and rather
      sad; but her face was a pleasant one for all that; and from the first word
      that fell from her lips, any stranger would at once conclude that she was
      of a serious and particularly sincere nature. In spite of her sorrowful
      expression, she gave the idea of possessing considerable firmness and
      decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her dress was modest and simple to a degree, dark and elderly in style;
      but both her face and appearance gave evidence that she had seen better
      days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Varvara was a girl of some twenty-three summers, of middle height, thin,
      but possessing a face which, without being actually beautiful, had the
      rare quality of charm, and might fascinate even to the extent of
      passionate regard.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was very like her mother: she even dressed like her, which proved that
      she had no taste for smart clothes. The expression of her grey eyes was
      merry and gentle, when it was not, as lately, too full of thought and
      anxiety. The same decision and firmness was to be observed in her face as
      in her mother&rsquo;s, but her strength seemed to be more vigorous than that of
      Nina Alexandrovna. She was subject to outbursts of temper, of which even
      her brother was a little afraid.
    </p>
    <p>
      The present visitor, Ptitsin, was also afraid of her. This was a young
      fellow of something under thirty, dressed plainly, but neatly. His manners
      were good, but rather ponderously so. His dark beard bore evidence to the
      fact that he was not in any government employ. He could speak well, but
      preferred silence. On the whole he made a decidedly agreeable impression.
      He was clearly attracted by Varvara, and made no secret of his feelings.
      She trusted him in a friendly way, but had not shown him any decided
      encouragement as yet, which fact did not quell his ardour in the least.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nina Alexandrovna was very fond of him, and had grown quite confidential
      with him of late. Ptitsin, as was well known, was engaged in the business
      of lending out money on good security, and at a good rate of interest. He
      was a great friend of Gania&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a formal introduction by Gania (who greeted his mother very shortly,
      took no notice of his sister, and immediately marched Ptitsin out of the
      room), Nina Alexandrovna addressed a few kind words to the prince and
      forthwith requested Colia, who had just appeared at the door, to show him
      to the &ldquo;middle room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colia was a nice-looking boy. His expression was simple and confiding, and
      his manners were very polite and engaging.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your luggage?&rdquo; he asked, as he led the prince away to his room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had a bundle; it&rsquo;s in the entrance hall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring it you directly. We only have a cook and one maid, so I have
      to help as much as I can. Varia looks after things, generally, and loses
      her temper over it. Gania says you have only just arrived from
      Switzerland?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it jolly there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mountains?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and get your bundle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Varvara joined them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The maid shall bring your bed-linen directly. Have you a portmanteau?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; a bundle&mdash;your brother has just gone to the hall for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing there except this,&rdquo; said Colia, returning at this moment.
      &ldquo;Where did you put it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! but that&rsquo;s all I have,&rdquo; said the prince, taking it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I thought perhaps Ferdishenko had taken it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk nonsense,&rdquo; said Varia, severely. She seemed put out, and was
      only just polite with the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oho!&rdquo; laughed the boy, &ldquo;you can be nicer than that to <i>me</i>, you know&mdash;I&rsquo;m
      not Ptitsin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to be whipped, Colia, you silly boy. If you want anything&rdquo; (to
      the prince) &ldquo;please apply to the servant. We dine at half-past four. You
      can take your dinner with us, or have it in your room, just as you please.
      Come along, Colia, don&rsquo;t disturb the prince.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the door they met Gania coming in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is father in?&rdquo; he asked. Colia whispered something in his ear and went
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a couple of words, prince, if you&rsquo;ll excuse me. Don&rsquo;t blab over <i>there</i>
      about what you may see here, or in this house as to all that about Aglaya
      and me, you know. Things are not altogether pleasant in this establishment&mdash;devil
      take it all! You&rsquo;ll see. At all events keep your tongue to yourself for <i>today</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you I &lsquo;blabbed&rsquo; a great deal less than you seem to suppose,&rdquo;
       said the prince, with some annoyance. Clearly the relations between Gania
      and himself were by no means improving.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh well; I caught it quite hot enough today, thanks to you. However, I
      forgive you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you might fairly remember that I was not in any way bound, I had
      no reason to be silent about that portrait. You never asked me not to
      mention it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pfu! what a wretched room this is&mdash;dark, and the window looking into
      the yard. Your coming to our house is, in no respect, opportune. However,
      it&rsquo;s not <i>my</i> affair. I don&rsquo;t keep the lodgings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ptitsin here looked in and beckoned to Gania, who hastily left the room,
      in spite of the fact that he had evidently wished to say something more
      and had only made the remark about the room to gain time. The prince had
      hardly had time to wash and tidy himself a little when the door opened
      once more, and another figure appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a gentleman of about thirty, tall, broad-shouldered, and
      red-haired; his face was red, too, and he possessed a pair of thick lips,
      a wide nose, small eyes, rather bloodshot, and with an ironical expression
      in them; as though he were perpetually winking at someone. His whole
      appearance gave one the idea of impudence; his dress was shabby.
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened the door just enough to let his head in. His head remained so
      placed for a few seconds while he quietly scrutinized the room; the door
      then opened enough to admit his body; but still he did not enter. He stood
      on the threshold and examined the prince carefully. At last he gave the
      door a final shove, entered, approached the prince, took his hand and
      seated himself and the owner of the room on two chairs side by side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ferdishenko,&rdquo; he said, gazing intently and inquiringly into the prince&rsquo;s
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, what next?&rdquo; said the latter, almost laughing in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lodger here,&rdquo; continued the other, staring as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you wish to make acquaintance?&rdquo; asked the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the visitor, passing his fingers through his hair and sighing.
      He then looked over to the other side of the room and around it. &ldquo;Got any
      money?&rdquo; he asked, suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty-five roubles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince took his banknote out and showed it to Ferdishenko. The latter
      unfolded it and looked at it; then he turned it round and examined the
      other side; then he held it up to the light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How strange that it should have browned so,&rdquo; he said, reflectively.
      &ldquo;These twenty-five rouble notes brown in a most extraordinary way, while
      other notes often grow paler. Take it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince took his note. Ferdishenko rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came here to warn you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;In the first place, don&rsquo;t lend me any
      money, for I shall certainly ask you to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall you pay here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I intend to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I <i>don&rsquo;t</i> intend to. Thanks. I live here, next door to you; you
      noticed a room, did you? Don&rsquo;t come to me very often; I shall see you here
      quite often enough. Have you seen the general?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor heard him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; of course not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll both hear and see him soon; he even tries to borrow money
      from me. <i>Avis au lecteur.</i> Good-bye; do you think a man can possibly
      live with a name like Ferdishenko?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so he departed. The prince found out afterwards that this gentleman
      made it his business to amaze people with his originality and wit, but
      that it did not as a rule &ldquo;come off.&rdquo; He even produced a bad impression on
      some people, which grieved him sorely; but he did not change his ways for
      all that.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he went out of the prince&rsquo;s room, he collided with yet another visitor
      coming in. Ferdishenko took the opportunity of making several warning
      gestures to the prince from behind the new arrival&rsquo;s back, and left the
      room in conscious pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      This next arrival was a tall red-faced man of about fifty-five, with
      greyish hair and whiskers, and large eyes which stood out of their
      sockets. His appearance would have been distinguished had it not been that
      he gave the idea of being rather dirty. He was dressed in an old coat, and
      he smelled of vodka when he came near. His walk was effective, and he
      clearly did his best to appear dignified, and to impress people by his
      manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      This gentleman now approached the prince slowly, and with a most courteous
      smile; silently took his hand and held it in his own, as he examined the
      prince&rsquo;s features as though searching for familiar traits therein.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis he, &lsquo;tis he!&rdquo; he said at last, quietly, but with much solemnity. &ldquo;As
      though he were alive once more. I heard the familiar name&mdash;the dear
      familiar name&mdash;and, oh! how it reminded me of the irrevocable past&mdash;Prince
      Muishkin, I believe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;General Ivolgin&mdash;retired and unfortunate. May I ask your Christian
      and generic names?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lef Nicolaievitch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, so&mdash;the son of my old, I may say my childhood&rsquo;s friend, Nicolai
      Petrovitch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father&rsquo;s name was Nicolai Lvovitch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lvovitch,&rdquo; repeated the general without the slightest haste, and with
      perfect confidence, just as though he had not committed himself the least
      in the world, but merely made a little slip of the tongue. He sat down,
      and taking the prince&rsquo;s hand, drew him to a seat next to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I carried you in my arms as a baby,&rdquo; he observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really?&rdquo; asked the prince. &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s twenty years since my father died.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes&mdash;twenty years and three months. We were educated together;
      I went straight into the army, and he&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father went into the army, too. He was a sub-lieutenant in the
      Vasiliefsky regiment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir&mdash;in the Bielomirsky; he changed into the latter shortly
      before his death. I was at his bedside when he died, and gave him my
      blessing for eternity. Your mother&mdash;&rdquo; The general paused, as though
      overcome with emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She died a few months later, from a cold,&rdquo; said the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not cold&mdash;believe an old man&mdash;not from a cold, but from
      grief for her prince. Oh&mdash;your mother, your mother! heigh-ho! Youth&mdash;youth!
      Your father and I&mdash;old friends as we were&mdash;nearly murdered each
      other for her sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince began to be a little incredulous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was passionately in love with her when she was engaged&mdash;engaged to
      my friend. The prince noticed the fact and was furious. He came and woke
      me at seven o&rsquo;clock one morning. I rise and dress in amazement; silence on
      both sides. I understand it all. He takes a couple of pistols out of his
      pocket&mdash;across a handkerchief&mdash;without witnesses. Why invite
      witnesses when both of us would be walking in eternity in a couple of
      minutes? The pistols are loaded; we stretch the handkerchief and stand
      opposite one another. We aim the pistols at each other&rsquo;s hearts. Suddenly
      tears start to our eyes, our hands shake; we weep, we embrace&mdash;the
      battle is one of self-sacrifice now! The prince shouts, &lsquo;She is yours;&rsquo; I
      cry, &lsquo;She is yours&mdash;&rsquo; in a word, in a word&mdash;You&rsquo;ve come to live
      with us, hey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;for a while, I think,&rdquo; stammered the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prince, mother begs you to come to her,&rdquo; said Colia, appearing at the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince rose to go, but the general once more laid his hand in a
      friendly manner on his shoulder, and dragged him down on to the sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As the true friend of your father, I wish to say a few words to you,&rdquo; he
      began. &ldquo;I have suffered&mdash;there was a catastrophe. I suffered without
      a trial; I had no trial. Nina Alexandrovna my wife, is an excellent woman,
      so is my daughter Varvara. We have to let lodgings because we are poor&mdash;a
      dreadful, unheard-of come-down for us&mdash;for me, who should have been a
      governor-general; but we are very glad to have <i>you</i>, at all events.
      Meanwhile there is a tragedy in the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince looked inquiringly at the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a marriage is being arranged&mdash;a marriage between a questionable
      woman and a young fellow who might be a flunkey. They wish to bring this
      woman into the house where my wife and daughter reside, but while I live
      and breathe she shall never enter my doors. I shall lie at the threshold,
      and she shall trample me underfoot if she does. I hardly talk to Gania
      now, and avoid him as much as I can. I warn you of this beforehand, but
      you cannot fail to observe it. But you are the son of my old friend, and I
      hope&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prince, be so kind as to come to me for a moment in the drawing-room,&rdquo;
       said Nina Alexandrovna herself, appearing at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Imagine, my dear,&rdquo; cried the general, &ldquo;it turns out that I have nursed
      the prince on my knee in the old days.&rdquo; His wife looked searchingly at
      him, and glanced at the prince, but said nothing. The prince rose and
      followed her; but hardly had they reached the drawing-room, and Nina
      Alexandrovna had begun to talk hurriedly, when in came the general. She
      immediately relapsed into silence. The master of the house may have
      observed this, but at all events he did not take any notice of it; he was
      in high good humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A son of my old friend, dear,&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;surely you must remember Prince
      Nicolai Lvovitch? You saw him at&mdash;at Tver.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember any Nicolai Lvovitch. Was that your father?&rdquo; she
      inquired of the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but he died at Elizabethgrad, not at Tver,&rdquo; said the prince, rather
      timidly. &ldquo;So Pavlicheff told me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Tver,&rdquo; insisted the general; &ldquo;he removed just before his death. You
      were very small and cannot remember; and Pavlicheff, though an excellent
      fellow, may have made a mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You knew Pavlicheff then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes&mdash;a wonderful fellow; but I was present myself. I gave him my
      blessing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father was just about to be tried when he died,&rdquo; said the prince,
      &ldquo;although I never knew of what he was accused. He died in hospital.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! it was the Kolpakoff business, and of course he would have been
      acquitted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes? Do you know that for a fact?&rdquo; asked the prince, whose curiosity was
      aroused by the general&rsquo;s words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think so indeed!&rdquo; cried the latter. &ldquo;The court-martial came to
      no decision. It was a mysterious, an impossible business, one might say!
      Captain Larionoff, commander of the company, had died; his command was
      handed over to the prince for the moment. Very well. This soldier,
      Kolpakoff, stole some leather from one of his comrades, intending to sell
      it, and spent the money on drink. Well! The prince&mdash;you understand
      that what follows took place in the presence of the sergeant-major, and a
      corporal&mdash;the prince rated Kolpakoff soundly, and threatened to have
      him flogged. Well, Kolpakoff went back to the barracks, lay down on a camp
      bedstead, and in a quarter of an hour was dead: you quite understand? It
      was, as I said, a strange, almost impossible, affair. In due course
      Kolpakoff was buried; the prince wrote his report, the deceased&rsquo;s name was
      removed from the roll. All as it should be, is it not? But exactly three
      months later at the inspection of the brigade, the man Kolpakoff was found
      in the third company of the second battalion of infantry, Novozemlianski
      division, just as if nothing had happened!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; said the prince, much astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It did not occur&mdash;it&rsquo;s a mistake!&rdquo; said Nina Alexandrovna quickly,
      looking, at the prince rather anxiously. &ldquo;<i>Mon mari se trompe</i>,&rdquo; she
      added, speaking in French.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, &lsquo;<i>se trompe</i>&rsquo; is easily said. Do you remember any case at
      all like it? Everybody was at their wits&rsquo; end. I should be the first to
      say &lsquo;<i>qu&rsquo;on se trompe</i>,&rsquo; but unfortunately I was an eye-witness, and
      was also on the commission of inquiry. Everything proved that it was
      really he, the very same soldier Kolpakoff who had been given the usual
      military funeral to the sound of the drum. It is of course a most curious
      case&mdash;nearly an impossible one. I recognize that... but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, your dinner is ready,&rdquo; said Varvara at this point, putting her
      head in at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very glad, I&rsquo;m particularly hungry. Yes, yes, a strange coincidence&mdash;almost
      a psychological&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your soup&rsquo;ll be cold; do come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coming, coming,&rdquo; said the general. &ldquo;Son of my old friend&mdash;&rdquo; he was
      heard muttering as he went down the passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will have to excuse very much in my husband, if you stay with us,&rdquo;
       said Nina Alexandrovna; &ldquo;but he will not disturb you often. He dines
      alone. Everyone has his little peculiarities, you know, and some people
      perhaps have more than those who are most pointed at and laughed at. One
      thing I must beg of you&mdash;if my husband applies to you for payment for
      board and lodging, tell him that you have already paid me. Of course
      anything paid by you to the general would be as fully settled as if paid
      to me, so far as you are concerned; but I wish it to be so, if you please,
      for convenience&rsquo; sake. What is it, Varia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Varia had quietly entered the room, and was holding out the portrait of
      Nastasia Philipovna to her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nina Alexandrovna started, and examined the photograph intently, gazing at
      it long and sadly. At last she looked up inquiringly at Varia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a present from herself to him,&rdquo; said Varia; &ldquo;the question is to be
      finally decided this evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This evening!&rdquo; repeated her mother in a tone of despair, but softly, as
      though to herself. &ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s all settled, of course, and there&rsquo;s no hope
      left to us. She has anticipated her answer by the present of her portrait.
      Did he show it you himself?&rdquo; she added, in some surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know we have hardly spoken to each other for a whole month. Ptitsin
      told me all about it; and the photo was lying under the table, and I
      picked it up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prince,&rdquo; asked Nina Alexandrovna, &ldquo;I wanted to inquire whether you have
      known my son long? I think he said that you had only arrived today from
      somewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince gave a short narrative of what we have heard before, leaving
      out the greater part. The two ladies listened intently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not ask about Gania out of curiosity,&rdquo; said the elder, at last. &ldquo;I
      wish to know how much you know about him, because he said just now that we
      need not stand on ceremony with you. What, exactly, does that mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Gania and Ptitsin entered the room together, and Nina
      Alexandrovna immediately became silent again. The prince remained seated
      next to her, but Varia moved to the other end of the room; the portrait of
      Nastasia Philipovna remained lying as before on the work-table. Gania
      observed it there, and with a frown of annoyance snatched it up and threw
      it across to his writing-table, which stood at the other end of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it today, Gania?&rdquo; asked Nina Alexandrovna, at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is what today?&rdquo; cried the former. Then suddenly recollecting himself, he
      turned sharply on the prince. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he growled, &ldquo;I see, you are here, that
      explains it! Is it a disease, or what, that you can&rsquo;t hold your tongue?
      Look here, understand once for all, prince&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am to blame in this, Gania&mdash;no one else,&rdquo; said Ptitsin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gania glanced inquiringly at the speaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s better so, you know, Gania&mdash;especially as, from one point of
      view, the matter may be considered as settled,&rdquo; said Ptitsin; and sitting
      down a little way from the table he began to study a paper covered with
      pencil writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gania stood and frowned, he expected a family scene. He never thought of
      apologizing to the prince, however.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s all settled, Gania, then of course Mr. Ptitsin is right,&rdquo; said
      Nina Alexandrovna. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t frown. You need not worry yourself, Gania; I
      shall ask you no questions. You need not tell me anything you don&rsquo;t like.
      I assure you I have quite submitted to your will.&rdquo; She said all this,
      knitting away the while as though perfectly calm and composed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gania was surprised, but cautiously kept silence and looked at his mother,
      hoping that she would express herself more clearly. Nina Alexandrovna
      observed his cautiousness and added, with a bitter smile:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are still suspicious, I see, and do not believe me; but you may be
      quite at your ease. There shall be no more tears, nor questions&mdash;not
      from my side, at all events. All I wish is that you may be happy, you know
      that. I have submitted to my fate; but my heart will always be with you,
      whether we remain united, or whether we part. Of course I only answer for
      myself&mdash;you can hardly expect your sister&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My sister again,&rdquo; cried Gania, looking at her with contempt and almost
      hate. &ldquo;Look here, mother, I have already given you my word that I shall
      always respect you fully and absolutely, and so shall everyone else in
      this house, be it who it may, who shall cross this threshold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gania was so much relieved that he gazed at his mother almost
      affectionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was not at all afraid for myself, Gania, as you know well. It was not
      for my own sake that I have been so anxious and worried all this time!
      They say it is all to be settled to-day. What is to be settled?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has promised to tell me tonight at her own house whether she consents
      or not,&rdquo; replied Gania.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have been silent on this subject for three weeks,&rdquo; said his mother,
      &ldquo;and it was better so; and now I will only ask you one question. How can
      she give her consent and make you a present of her portrait when you do
      not love her? How can such a&mdash;such a&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Practised hand&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was not going to express myself so. But how could you so blind her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nina Alexandrovna&rsquo;s question betrayed intense annoyance. Gania waited a
      moment and then said, without taking the trouble to conceal the irony of
      his tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you are, mother, you are always like that. You begin by promising
      that there are to be no reproaches or insinuations or questions, and here
      you are beginning them at once. We had better drop the subject&mdash;we
      had, really. I shall never leave you, mother; any other man would cut and
      run from such a sister as this. See how she is looking at me at this
      moment! Besides, how do you know that I am blinding Nastasia Philipovna?
      As for Varia, I don&rsquo;t care&mdash;she can do just as she pleases. There,
      that&rsquo;s quite enough!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gania&rsquo;s irritation increased with every word he uttered, as he walked up
      and down the room. These conversations always touched the family sores
      before long.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have said already that the moment she comes in I go out, and I shall
      keep my word,&rdquo; remarked Varia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out of obstinacy&rdquo; shouted Gania. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t married, either, thanks to
      your obstinacy. Oh, you needn&rsquo;t frown at me, Varvara! You can go at once
      for all I care; I am sick enough of your company. What, you are going to
      leave us are you, too?&rdquo; he cried, turning to the prince, who was rising
      from his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gania&rsquo;s voice was full of the most uncontrolled and uncontrollable
      irritation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince turned at the door to say something, but perceiving in Gania&rsquo;s
      expression that there was but that one drop wanting to make the cup
      overflow, he changed his mind and left the room without a word. A few
      minutes later he was aware from the noisy voices in the drawing room, that
      the conversation had become more quarrelsome than ever after his
      departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      He crossed the salon and the entrance-hall, so as to pass down the
      corridor into his own room. As he came near the front door he heard
      someone outside vainly endeavouring to ring the bell, which was evidently
      broken, and only shook a little, without emitting any sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince took down the chain and opened the door. He started back in
      amazement&mdash;for there stood Nastasia Philipovna. He knew her at once
      from her photograph. Her eyes blazed with anger as she looked at him. She
      quickly pushed by him into the hall, shouldering him out of her way, and
      said, furiously, as she threw off her fur cloak:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are too lazy to mend your bell, you should at least wait in the
      hall to let people in when they rattle the bell handle. There, now, you&rsquo;ve
      dropped my fur cloak&mdash;dummy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sure enough the cloak was lying on the ground. Nastasia had thrown it off
      her towards the prince, expecting him to catch it, but the prince had
      missed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now then&mdash;announce me, quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince wanted to say something, but was so confused and astonished
      that he could not. However, he moved off towards the drawing-room with the
      cloak over his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now then, where are you taking my cloak to? Ha, ha, ha! Are you mad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince turned and came back, more confused than ever. When she burst
      out laughing, he smiled, but his tongue could not form a word as yet. At
      first, when he had opened the door and saw her standing before him, he had
      become as pale as death; but now the red blood had rushed back to his
      cheeks in a torrent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what an idiot it is!&rdquo; cried Nastasia, stamping her foot with
      irritation. &ldquo;Go on, do! Whom are you going to announce?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nastasia Philipovna,&rdquo; murmured the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how do you know that?&rdquo; she asked him, sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never seen you before!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, announce me&mdash;what&rsquo;s that noise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are quarrelling,&rdquo; said the prince, and entered the drawing-room,
      just as matters in there had almost reached a crisis. Nina Alexandrovna
      had forgotten that she had &ldquo;submitted to everything!&rdquo; She was defending
      Varia. Ptitsin was taking her part, too. Not that Varia was afraid of
      standing up for herself. She was by no means that sort of a girl; but her
      brother was becoming ruder and more intolerable every moment. Her usual
      practice in such cases as the present was to say nothing, but stare at
      him, without taking her eyes off his face for an instant. This manoeuvre,
      as she well knew, could drive Gania distracted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just at this moment the door opened and the prince entered, announcing:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nastasia Philipovna!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <h3>
      IX.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Silence immediately fell on the room; all looked at the prince as though
      they neither understood, nor hoped to understand. Gania was motionless
      with horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nastasia&rsquo;s arrival was a most unexpected and overwhelming event to all
      parties. In the first place, she had never been before. Up to now she had
      been so haughty that she had never even asked Gania to introduce her to
      his parents. Of late she had not so much as mentioned them. Gania was
      partly glad of this; but still he had put it to her debit in the account
      to be settled after marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would have borne anything from her rather than this visit. But one
      thing seemed to him quite clear&mdash;her visit now, and the present of her
      portrait on this particular day, pointed out plainly enough which way she
      intended to make her decision!
    </p>
    <p>
      The incredulous amazement with which all regarded the prince did not last
      long, for Nastasia herself appeared at the door and passed in, pushing by
      the prince again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last I&rsquo;ve stormed the citadel! Why do you tie up your bell?&rdquo; she said,
      merrily, as she pressed Gania&rsquo;s hand, the latter having rushed up to her
      as soon as she made her appearance. &ldquo;What are you looking so upset about?
      Introduce me, please!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bewildered Gania introduced her first to Varia, and both women, before
      shaking hands, exchanged looks of strange import. Nastasia, however,
      smiled amiably; but Varia did not try to look amiable, and kept her gloomy
      expression. She did not even vouchsafe the usual courteous smile of
      etiquette. Gania darted a terrible glance of wrath at her for this, but
      Nina Alexandrovna mended matters a little when Gania introduced her at
      last. Hardly, however, had the old lady begun about her &ldquo;highly gratified
      feelings,&rdquo; and so on, when Nastasia left her, and flounced into a chair by
      Gania&rsquo;s side in the corner by the window, and cried: &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your study?
      and where are the&mdash;the lodgers? You do take in lodgers, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gania looked dreadfully put out, and tried to say something in reply, but
      Nastasia interrupted him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, where are you going to squeeze lodgers in here? Don&rsquo;t you use a
      study? Does this sort of thing pay?&rdquo; she added, turning to Nina
      Alexandrovna.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it is troublesome, rather,&rdquo; said the latter; &ldquo;but I suppose it will
      &lsquo;pay&rsquo; pretty well. We have only just begun, however&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Nastasia Philipovna did not hear the sentence out. She glanced at
      Gania, and cried, laughing, &ldquo;What a face! My goodness, what a face you
      have on at this moment!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, Gania did not look in the least like himself. His bewilderment and
      his alarmed perplexity passed off, however, and his lips now twitched with
      rage as he continued to stare evilly at his laughing guest, while his
      countenance became absolutely livid.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was another witness, who, though standing at the door motionless and
      bewildered himself, still managed to remark Gania&rsquo;s death-like pallor, and
      the dreadful change that had come over his face. This witness was the
      prince, who now advanced in alarm and muttered to Gania:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drink some water, and don&rsquo;t look like that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was clear that he came out with these words quite spontaneously, on the
      spur of the moment. But his speech was productive of much&mdash;for it
      appeared that all Gania&rsquo;s rage now overflowed upon the prince. He seized
      him by the shoulder and gazed with an intensity of loathing and revenge at
      him, but said nothing&mdash;as though his feelings were too strong to
      permit of words.
    </p>
    <p>
      General agitation prevailed. Nina Alexandrovna gave a little cry of
      anxiety; Ptitsin took a step forward in alarm; Colia and Ferdishenko stood
      stock still at the door in amazement;&mdash;only Varia remained coolly
      watching the scene from under her eyelashes. She did not sit down, but
      stood by her mother with folded hands. However, Gania recollected himself
      almost immediately. He let go of the prince and burst out laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, are you a doctor, prince, or what?&rdquo; he asked, as naturally as
      possible. &ldquo;I declare you quite frightened me! Nastasia Philipovna, let me
      introduce this interesting character to you&mdash;though I have only known
      him myself since the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nastasia gazed at the prince in bewilderment. &ldquo;Prince? He a Prince? Why, I
      took him for the footman, just now, and sent him in to announce me! Ha,
      ha, ha, isn&rsquo;t that good!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not bad that, not bad at all!&rdquo; put in Ferdishenko, &ldquo;<i>se non è vero</i>&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I rather think I pitched into you, too, didn&rsquo;t I? Forgive me&mdash;do!
      Who is he, did you say? What prince? Muishkin?&rdquo; she added, addressing
      Gania.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a lodger of ours,&rdquo; explained the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An idiot!&rdquo;&mdash;the prince distinctly heard the word half whispered from
      behind him. This was Ferdishenko&rsquo;s voluntary information for Nastasia&rsquo;s
      benefit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, why didn&rsquo;t you put me right when I made such a dreadful mistake
      just now?&rdquo; continued the latter, examining the prince from head to foot
      without the slightest ceremony. She awaited the answer as though convinced
      that it would be so foolish that she must inevitably fail to restrain her
      laughter over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was astonished, seeing you so suddenly&mdash;&rdquo; murmured the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you know who I was? Where had you seen me before? And why were
      you so struck dumb at the sight of me? What was there so overwhelming
      about me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oho! ho, ho, ho!&rdquo; cried Ferdishenko. &ldquo;<i>Now</i> then, prince! My word,
      what things I would say if I had such a chance as that! My goodness,
      prince&mdash;go on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So should I, in your place, I&rsquo;ve no doubt!&rdquo; laughed the prince to
      Ferdishenko; then continued, addressing Nastasia: &ldquo;Your portrait struck me
      very forcibly this morning; then I was talking about you to the Epanchins;
      and then, in the train, before I reached Petersburg, Parfen Rogojin told
      me a good deal about you; and at the very moment that I opened the door to
      you I happened to be thinking of you, when&mdash;there you stood before
      me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how did you recognize me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the portrait!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I seemed to imagine you exactly as you are&mdash;I seemed to have seen
      you somewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&mdash;where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I seem to have seen your eyes somewhere; but it cannot be! I have not
      seen you&mdash;I never was here before. I may have dreamed of you, I don&rsquo;t
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince said all this with manifest effort&mdash;in broken sentences,
      and with many drawings of breath. He was evidently much agitated. Nastasia
      Philipovna looked at him inquisitively, but did not laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo, prince!&rdquo; cried Ferdishenko, delighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment a loud voice from behind the group which hedged in the
      prince and Nastasia Philipovna, divided the crowd, as it were, and before
      them stood the head of the family, General Ivolgin. He was dressed in
      evening clothes; his moustache was dyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      This apparition was too much for Gania. Vain and ambitious almost to
      morbidness, he had had much to put up with in the last two months, and was
      seeking feverishly for some means of enabling himself to lead a more
      presentable kind of existence. At home, he now adopted an attitude of
      absolute cynicism, but he could not keep this up before Nastasia
      Philipovna, although he had sworn to make her pay after marriage for all
      he suffered now. He was experiencing a last humiliation, the bitterest of
      all, at this moment&mdash;the humiliation of blushing for his own kindred
      in his own house. A question flashed through his mind as to whether the
      game was really worth the candle.
    </p>
    <p>
      For that had happened at this moment, which for two months had been his
      nightmare; which had filled his soul with dread and shame&mdash;the
      meeting between his father and Nastasia Philipovna. He had often tried to
      imagine such an event, but had found the picture too mortifying and
      exasperating, and had quietly dropped it. Very likely he anticipated far
      worse things than was at all necessary; it is often so with vain persons.
      He had long since determined, therefore, to get his father out of the way,
      anywhere, before his marriage, in order to avoid such a meeting; but when
      Nastasia entered the room just now, he had been so overwhelmed with
      astonishment, that he had not thought of his father, and had made no
      arrangements to keep him out of the way. And now it was too late&mdash;there
      he was, and got up, too, in a dress coat and white tie, and Nastasia in
      the very humour to heap ridicule on him and his family circle; of this
      last fact, he felt quite persuaded. What else had she come for? There were
      his mother and his sister sitting before her, and she seemed to have
      forgotten their very existence already; and if she behaved like that, he
      thought, she must have some object in view.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ferdishenko led the general up to Nastasia Philipovna.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ardalion Alexandrovitch Ivolgin,&rdquo; said the smiling general, with a low
      bow of great dignity, &ldquo;an old soldier, unfortunate, and the father of this
      family; but happy in the hope of including in that family so exquisite&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not finish his sentence, for at this moment Ferdishenko pushed a
      chair up from behind, and the general, not very firm on his legs, at this
      post-prandial hour, flopped into it backwards. It was always a difficult
      thing to put this warrior to confusion, and his sudden descent left him as
      composed as before. He had sat down just opposite to Nastasia, whose
      fingers he now took, and raised to his lips with great elegance, and much
      courtesy. The general had once belonged to a very select circle of
      society, but he had been turned out of it two or three years since on
      account of certain weaknesses, in which he now indulged with all the less
      restraint; but his good manners remained with him to this day, in spite of
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nastasia Philipovna seemed delighted at the appearance of this latest
      arrival, of whom she had of course heard a good deal by report.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard that my son&mdash;&rdquo; began Ardalion Alexandrovitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your son, indeed! A nice papa you are! <i>You</i> might have come to see
      me anyhow, without compromising anyone. Do you hide yourself, or does your
      son hide you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The children of the nineteenth century, and their parents&mdash;&rdquo; began
      the general, again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nastasia Philipovna, will you excuse the general for a moment? Someone is
      inquiring for him,&rdquo; said Nina Alexandrovna in a loud voice, interrupting
      the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse him? Oh no, I have wished to see him too long for that. Why, what
      business can he have? He has retired, hasn&rsquo;t he? You won&rsquo;t leave me,
      general, will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I give you my word that he shall come and see you&mdash;but he&mdash;he
      needs rest just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;General, they say you require rest,&rdquo; said Nastasia Philipovna, with the
      melancholy face of a child whose toy is taken away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ardalion Alexandrovitch immediately did his best to make his foolish
      position a great deal worse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, my dear!&rdquo; he said, solemnly and reproachfully, looking at his
      wife, with one hand on his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you leave the room, mamma?&rdquo; asked Varia, aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Varia, I shall sit it out to the end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nastasia must have overheard both question and reply, but her vivacity was
      not in the least damped. On the contrary, it seemed to increase. She
      immediately overwhelmed the general once more with questions, and within
      five minutes that gentleman was as happy as a king, and holding forth at
      the top of his voice, amid the laughter of almost all who heard him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colia jogged the prince&rsquo;s arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t <i>you</i> get him out of the room, somehow? <i>Do</i>, please,&rdquo;
       and tears of annoyance stood in the boy&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;Curse that Gania!&rdquo; he
      muttered, between his teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, I knew General Epanchin well,&rdquo; General Ivolgin was saying at this
      moment; &ldquo;he and Prince Nicolai Ivanovitch Muishkin&mdash;whose son I have
      this day embraced after an absence of twenty years&mdash;and I, were three
      inseparables. Alas one is in the grave, torn to pieces by calumnies and
      bullets; another is now before you, still battling with calumnies and
      bullets&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bullets?&rdquo; cried Nastasia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, here in my chest. I received them at the siege of Kars, and I feel
      them in bad weather now. And as to the third of our trio, Epanchin, of
      course after that little affair with the poodle in the railway carriage,
      it was all <i>up</i> between us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poodle? What was that? And in a railway carriage? Dear me,&rdquo; said
      Nastasia, thoughtfully, as though trying to recall something to mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, just a silly, little occurrence, really not worth telling, about
      Princess Bielokonski&rsquo;s governess, Miss Smith, and&mdash;oh, it is really
      not worth telling!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, we must have it!&rdquo; cried Nastasia merrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of course,&rdquo; said Ferdishenko. &ldquo;C&rsquo;est du nouveau.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ardalion,&rdquo; said Nina Alexandrovitch, entreatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa, you are wanted!&rdquo; cried Colia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it is a silly little story, in a few words,&rdquo; began the delighted
      general. &ldquo;A couple of years ago, soon after the new railway was opened, I
      had to go somewhere or other on business. Well, I took a first-class
      ticket, sat down, and began to smoke, or rather <i>continued</i> to smoke,
      for I had lighted up before. I was alone in the carriage. Smoking is not
      allowed, but is not prohibited either; it is half allowed&mdash;so to
      speak, winked at. I had the window open.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suddenly, just before the whistle, in came two ladies with a little
      poodle, and sat down opposite to me; not bad-looking women; one was in
      light blue, the other in black silk. The poodle, a beauty with a silver
      collar, lay on light blue&rsquo;s knee. They looked haughtily about, and talked
      English together. I took no notice, just went on smoking. I observed that
      the ladies were getting angry&mdash;over my cigar, doubtless. One looked
      at me through her tortoise-shell eyeglass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I took no notice, because they never said a word. If they didn&rsquo;t like the
      cigar, why couldn&rsquo;t they say so? Not a word, not a hint! Suddenly, and
      without the very slightest suspicion of warning, &lsquo;light blue&rsquo; seizes my
      cigar from between my fingers, and, wheugh! out of the window with it!
      Well, on flew the train, and I sat bewildered, and the young woman, tall
      and fair, and rather red in the face, too red, glared at me with flashing
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say a word, but with extreme courtesy, I may say with most
      refined courtesy, I reached my finger and thumb over towards the poodle,
      took it up delicately by the nape of the neck, and chucked it out of the
      window, after the cigar. The train went flying on, and the poodle&rsquo;s yells
      were lost in the distance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you naughty man!&rdquo; cried Nastasia, laughing and clapping her hands
      like a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; said Ferdishenko. Ptitsin laughed too, though he had been very
      sorry to see the general appear. Even Colia laughed and said, &ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I was right, truly right,&rdquo; cried the general, with warmth and
      solemnity, &ldquo;for if cigars are forbidden in railway carriages, poodles are
      much more so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and what did the lady do?&rdquo; asked Nastasia, impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&mdash;ah, that&rsquo;s where all the mischief of it lies!&rdquo; replied Ivolgin,
      frowning. &ldquo;Without a word, as it were, of warning, she slapped me on the
      cheek! An extraordinary woman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The general dropped his eyes, and elevated his brows; shrugged his
      shoulders, tightened his lips, spread his hands, and remained silent. At
      last he blurted out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I lost my head!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you hit her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, oh no!&mdash;there was a great flare-up, but I didn&rsquo;t hit her! I had
      to struggle a little, purely to defend myself; but the very devil was in
      the business. It turned out that &lsquo;light blue&rsquo; was an Englishwoman,
      governess or something, at Princess Bielokonski&rsquo;s, and the other woman was
      one of the old-maid princesses Bielokonski. Well, everybody knows what
      great friends the princess and Mrs. Epanchin are, so there was a pretty
      kettle of fish. All the Bielokonskis went into mourning for the poodle.
      Six princesses in tears, and the Englishwoman shrieking!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I wrote an apology, and called, but they would not receive
      either me or my apology, and the Epanchins cut me, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But wait,&rdquo; said Nastasia. &ldquo;How is it that, five or six days since, I read
      exactly the same story in the paper, as happening between a Frenchman and
      an English girl? The cigar was snatched away exactly as you describe, and
      the poodle was chucked out of the window after it. The slapping came off,
      too, as in your case; and the girl&rsquo;s dress was light blue!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The general blushed dreadfully; Colia blushed too; and Ptitsin turned
      hastily away. Ferdishenko was the only one who laughed as gaily as before.
      As to Gania, I need not say that he was miserable; he stood dumb and
      wretched and took no notice of anybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you,&rdquo; said the general, &ldquo;that exactly the same thing happened to
      myself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remembered there was some quarrel between father and Miss Smith, the
      Bielokonski&rsquo;s governess,&rdquo; said Colia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How very curious, point for point the same anecdote, and happening at
      different ends of Europe! Even the light blue dress the same,&rdquo; continued
      the pitiless Nastasia. &ldquo;I must really send you the paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must observe,&rdquo; insisted the general, &ldquo;that my experience was two
      years earlier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! that&rsquo;s it, no doubt!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nastasia Philipovna laughed hysterically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, will you hear a word from me outside!&rdquo; said Gania, his voice
      shaking with agitation, as he seized his father by the shoulder. His eyes
      shone with a blaze of hatred.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment there was a terrific bang at the front door, almost enough
      to break it down. Some most unusual visitor must have arrived. Colia ran
      to open.
    </p>
    <h3>
      X.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The entrance-hall suddenly became full of noise and people. To judge from
      the sounds which penetrated to the drawing-room, a number of people had
      already come in, and the stampede continued. Several voices were talking
      and shouting at once; others were talking and shouting on the stairs
      outside; it was evidently a most extraordinary visit that was about to
      take place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone exchanged startled glances. Gania rushed out towards the
      dining-room, but a number of men had already made their way in, and met
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! here he is, the Judas!&rdquo; cried a voice which the prince recognized at
      once. &ldquo;How d&rsquo;ye do, Gania, you old blackguard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s the man!&rdquo; said another voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no room for doubt in the prince&rsquo;s mind: one of the voices was
      Rogojin&rsquo;s, and the other Lebedeff&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gania stood at the door like a block and looked on in silence, putting no
      obstacle in the way of their entrance, and ten or a dozen men marched in
      behind Parfen Rogojin. They were a decidedly mixed-looking collection, and
      some of them came in in their furs and caps. None of them were quite
      drunk, but all appeared to be considerably excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      They seemed to need each other&rsquo;s support, morally, before they dared come
      in; not one of them would have entered alone but with the rest each one
      was brave enough. Even Rogojin entered rather cautiously at the head of
      his troop; but he was evidently preoccupied. He appeared to be gloomy and
      morose, and had clearly come with some end in view. All the rest were
      merely chorus, brought in to support the chief character. Besides Lebedeff
      there was the dandy Zalesheff, who came in without his coat and hat, two
      or three others followed his example; the rest were more uncouth. They
      included a couple of young merchants, a man in a great-coat, a medical
      student, a little Pole, a small fat man who laughed continuously, and an
      enormously tall stout one who apparently put great faith in the strength
      of his fists. A couple of &ldquo;ladies&rdquo; of some sort put their heads in at the
      front door, but did not dare come any farther. Colia promptly banged the
      door in their faces and locked it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo, Gania, you blackguard! You didn&rsquo;t expect Rogojin, eh?&rdquo; said the
      latter, entering the drawing-room, and stopping before Gania.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at this moment he saw, seated before him, Nastasia Philipovna. He had
      not dreamed of meeting her here, evidently, for her appearance produced a
      marvellous effect upon him. He grew pale, and his lips became actually
      blue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it is true, then!&rdquo; he muttered to himself, and his face took on
      an expression of despair. &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the end of it! Now you, sir, will you
      answer me or not?&rdquo; he went on suddenly, gazing at Gania with ineffable
      malice. &ldquo;Now then, you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He panted, and could hardly speak for agitation. He advanced into the room
      mechanically; but perceiving Nina Alexandrovna and Varia he became more or
      less embarrassed, in spite of his excitement. His followers entered after
      him, and all paused a moment at sight of the ladies. Of course their
      modesty was not fated to be long-lived, but for a moment they were
      abashed. Once let them begin to shout, however, and nothing on earth
      should disconcert them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, you here too, prince?&rdquo; said Rogojin, absently, but a little
      surprised all the same &ldquo;Still in your gaiters, eh?&rdquo; He sighed, and forgot
      the prince next moment, and his wild eyes wandered over to Nastasia again,
      as though attracted in that direction by some magnetic force.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nastasia looked at the new arrivals with great curiosity. Gania
      recollected himself at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, sirs,&rdquo; he said, loudly, &ldquo;but what does all this mean?&rdquo; He
      glared at the advancing crowd generally, but addressed his remarks
      especially to their captain, Rogojin. &ldquo;You are not in a stable, gentlemen,
      though you may think it&mdash;my mother and sister are present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I see your mother and sister,&rdquo; muttered Rogojin, through his teeth;
      and Lebedeff seemed to feel himself called upon to second the statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At all events, I must request you to step into the salon,&rdquo; said Gania,
      his rage rising quite out of proportion to his words, &ldquo;and then I shall
      inquire&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, he doesn&rsquo;t know me!&rdquo; said Rogojin, showing his teeth disagreeably.
      &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t recognize Rogojin!&rdquo; He did not move an inch, however.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have met you somewhere, I believe, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Met me somewhere, pfu! Why, it&rsquo;s only three months since I lost two
      hundred roubles of my father&rsquo;s money to you, at cards. The old fellow died
      before he found out. Ptitsin knows all about it. Why, I&rsquo;ve only to pull
      out a three-rouble note and show it to you, and you&rsquo;d crawl on your hands
      and knees to the other end of the town for it; that&rsquo;s the sort of man you
      are. Why, I&rsquo;ve come now, at this moment, to buy you up! Oh, you needn&rsquo;t
      think that because I wear these boots I have no money. I have lots of
      money, my beauty,&mdash;enough to buy up you and all yours together. So I
      shall, if I like to! I&rsquo;ll buy you up! I will!&rdquo; he yelled, apparently
      growing more and more intoxicated and excited. &ldquo;Oh, Nastasia Philipovna!
      don&rsquo;t turn me out! Say one word, do! Are you going to marry this man, or
      not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rogojin asked his question like a lost soul appealing to some divinity,
      with the reckless daring of one appointed to die, who has nothing to lose.
    </p>
    <p>
      He awaited the reply in deadly anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nastasia Philipovna gazed at him with a haughty, ironical expression of
      face; but when she glanced at Nina Alexandrovna and Varia, and from them
      to Gania, she changed her tone, all of a sudden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not; what are you thinking of? What could have induced you to
      ask such a question?&rdquo; she replied, quietly and seriously, and even,
      apparently, with some astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No? No?&rdquo; shouted Rogojin, almost out of his mind with joy. &ldquo;You are not
      going to, after all? And they told me&mdash;oh, Nastasia Philipovna&mdash;they
      said you had promised to marry him, <i>him!</i> As if you <i>could</i> do
      it!&mdash;him&mdash;pooh! I don&rsquo;t mind saying it to everyone&mdash;I&rsquo;d buy
      him off for a hundred roubles, any day pfu! Give him a thousand, or three
      if he likes, poor devil, and he&rsquo;d cut and run the day before his wedding,
      and leave his bride to me! Wouldn&rsquo;t you, Gania, you blackguard? You&rsquo;d take
      three thousand, wouldn&rsquo;t you? Here&rsquo;s the money! Look, I&rsquo;ve come on purpose
      to pay you off and get your receipt, formally. I said I&rsquo;d buy you up, and
      so I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get out of this, you drunken beast!&rdquo; cried Gania, who was red and white
      by turns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rogojin&rsquo;s troop, who were only waiting for an excuse, set up a howl at
      this. Lebedeff stepped forward and whispered something in Parfen&rsquo;s ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, clerk,&rdquo; said the latter, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re right, tipsy spirit&mdash;you&rsquo;re
      right!&mdash;Nastasia Philipovna,&rdquo; he added, looking at her like some
      lunatic, harmless generally, but suddenly wound up to a pitch of audacity,
      &ldquo;here are eighteen thousand roubles, and&mdash;and you shall have more&mdash;.&rdquo;
       Here he threw a packet of bank-notes tied up in white paper, on the table
      before her, not daring to say all he wished to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;no&mdash;no!&rdquo; muttered Lebedeff, clutching at his arm. He was
      clearly aghast at the largeness of the sum, and thought a far smaller
      amount should have been tried first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you fool&mdash;you don&rsquo;t know whom you are dealing with&mdash;and it
      appears I am a fool, too!&rdquo; said Parfen, trembling beneath the flashing
      glance of Nastasia. &ldquo;Oh, curse it all! What a fool I was to listen to
      you!&rdquo; he added, with profound melancholy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nastasia Philipovna, observing his woe-begone expression, suddenly burst
      out laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eighteen thousand roubles, for me? Why, you declare yourself a fool at
      once,&rdquo; she said, with impudent familiarity, as she rose from the sofa and
      prepared to go. Gania watched the whole scene with a sinking of the heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forty thousand, then&mdash;forty thousand roubles instead of eighteen!
      Ptitsin and another have promised to find me forty thousand roubles by
      seven o&rsquo;clock tonight. Forty thousand roubles&mdash;paid down on the
      nail!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The scene was growing more and more disgraceful; but Nastasia Philipovna
      continued to laugh and did not go away. Nina Alexandrovna and Varia had
      both risen from their places and were waiting, in silent horror, to see
      what would happen. Varia&rsquo;s eyes were all ablaze with anger; but the scene
      had a different effect on Nina Alexandrovna. She paled and trembled, and
      looked more and more like fainting every moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well then, a <i>hundred</i> thousand! a hundred thousand! paid this
      very day. Ptitsin! find it for me. A good share shall stick to your
      fingers&mdash;come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mad!&rdquo; said Ptitsin, coming up quickly and seizing him by the
      hand. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re drunk&mdash;the police will be sent for if you don&rsquo;t look
      out. Think where you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s boasting like a drunkard,&rdquo; added Nastasia, as though with the
      sole intention of goading him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do <i>not</i> boast! You shall have a hundred thousand, this very day.
      Ptitsin, get the money, you gay usurer! Take what you like for it, but get
      it by the evening! I&rsquo;ll show that I&rsquo;m in earnest!&rdquo; cried Rogojin, working
      himself up into a frenzy of excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come; what&rsquo;s all this?&rdquo; cried General Ivolgin, suddenly and
      angrily, coming close up to Rogojin. The unexpectedness of this sally on
      the part of the hitherto silent old man caused some laughter among the
      intruders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Halloa! what&rsquo;s this now?&rdquo; laughed Rogojin. &ldquo;You come along with me, old
      fellow! You shall have as much to drink as you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s too horrible!&rdquo; cried poor Colia, sobbing with shame and
      annoyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely there must be someone among all of you here who will turn this
      shameless creature out of the room?&rdquo; cried Varia, suddenly. She was
      shaking and trembling with rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s me, I suppose. I&rsquo;m the shameless creature!&rdquo; cried Nastasia
      Philipovna, with amused indifference. &ldquo;Dear me, and I came&mdash;like a
      fool, as I am&mdash;to invite them over to my house for the evening! Look
      how your sister treats me, Gavrila Ardalionovitch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For some moments Gania stood as if stunned or struck by lightning, after
      his sister&rsquo;s speech. But seeing that Nastasia Philipovna was really about
      to leave the room this time, he sprang at Varia and seized her by the arm
      like a madman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you done?&rdquo; he hissed, glaring at her as though he would like to
      annihilate her on the spot. He was quite beside himself, and could hardly
      articulate his words for rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have I done? Where are you dragging me to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you wish me to beg pardon of this creature because she has come here
      to insult our mother and disgrace the whole household, you low, base
      wretch?&rdquo; cried Varia, looking back at her brother with proud defiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few moments passed as they stood there face to face, Gania still holding
      her wrist tightly. Varia struggled once&mdash;twice&mdash;to get free;
      then could restrain herself no longer, and spat in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a girl for you!&rdquo; cried Nastasia Philipovna. &ldquo;Mr. Ptitsin, I
      congratulate you on your choice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gania lost his head. Forgetful of everything he aimed a blow at Varia,
      which would inevitably have laid her low, but suddenly another hand caught
      his. Between him and Varia stood the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough&mdash;enough!&rdquo; said the latter, with insistence, but all of a
      tremble with excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to cross my path for ever, damn you!&rdquo; cried Gania; and,
      loosening his hold on Varia, he slapped the prince&rsquo;s face with all his
      force.
    </p>
    <p>
      Exclamations of horror arose on all sides. The prince grew pale as death;
      he gazed into Gania&rsquo;s eyes with a strange, wild, reproachful look; his
      lips trembled and vainly endeavoured to form some words; then his mouth
      twisted into an incongruous smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well&mdash;never mind about me; but I shall not allow you to strike
      her!&rdquo; he said, at last, quietly. Then, suddenly, he could bear it no
      longer, and covering his face with his hands, turned to the wall, and
      murmured in broken accents:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! how ashamed you will be of this afterwards!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gania certainly did look dreadfully abashed. Colia rushed up to comfort
      the prince, and after him crowded Varia, Rogojin and all, even the
      general.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing, it&rsquo;s nothing!&rdquo; said the prince, and again he wore the smile
      which was so inconsistent with the circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he will be ashamed!&rdquo; cried Rogojin. &ldquo;You will be properly ashamed of
      yourself for having injured such a&mdash;such a sheep&rdquo; (he could not find
      a better word). &ldquo;Prince, my dear fellow, leave this and come away with me.
      I&rsquo;ll show you how Rogojin shows his affection for his friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nastasia Philipovna was also much impressed, both with Gania&rsquo;s action and
      with the prince&rsquo;s reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her usually thoughtful, pale face, which all this while had been so little
      in harmony with the jests and laughter which she had seemed to put on for
      the occasion, was now evidently agitated by new feelings, though she tried
      to conceal the fact and to look as though she were as ready as ever for
      jesting and irony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really think I must have seen him somewhere!&rdquo; she murmured seriously
      enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, aren&rsquo;t you ashamed of yourself&mdash;aren&rsquo;t you ashamed? Are you
      really the sort of woman you are trying to represent yourself to be? Is it
      possible?&rdquo; The prince was now addressing Nastasia, in a tone of reproach,
      which evidently came from his very heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nastasia Philipovna looked surprised, and smiled, but evidently concealed
      something beneath her smile and with some confusion and a glance at Gania
      she left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, she had not reached the outer hall when she turned round, walked
      quickly up to Nina Alexandrovna, seized her hand and lifted it to her
      lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He guessed quite right. I am not that sort of woman,&rdquo; she whispered
      hurriedly, flushing red all over. Then she turned again and left the room
      so quickly that no one could imagine what she had come back for. All they
      saw was that she said something to Nina Alexandrovna in a hurried whisper,
      and seemed to kiss her hand. Varia, however, both saw and heard all, and
      watched Nastasia out of the room with an expression of wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gania recollected himself in time to rush after her in order to show her
      out, but she had gone. He followed her to the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come with me,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;<i>Au revoir</i>, till the evening&mdash;do
      you hear? <i>Au revoir!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He returned thoughtful and confused; the riddle lay heavier than ever on
      his soul. He was troubled about the prince, too, and so bewildered that he
      did not even observe Rogojin&rsquo;s rowdy band crowd past him and step on his
      toes, at the door as they went out. They were all talking at once. Rogojin
      went ahead of the others, talking to Ptitsin, and apparently insisting
      vehemently upon something very important.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve lost the game, Gania&rdquo; he cried, as he passed the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gania gazed after him uneasily, but said nothing.
    </p>

    <p>
      The prince now left the room and shut himself up in his own chamber. Colia
      followed him almost at once, anxious to do what he could to console him.
      The poor boy seemed to be already so attached to him that he could hardly
      leave him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were quite right to go away!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The row will rage there worse
      than ever now; and it&rsquo;s like this every day with us&mdash;and all through
      that Nastasia Philipovna.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have so many sources of trouble here, Colia,&rdquo; said the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed, and it is all our own fault. But I have a great friend who
      is much worse off even than we are. Would you like to know him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, very much. Is he one of your school-fellows?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, not exactly. I will tell you all about him some day.... What do you
      think of Nastasia Philipovna? She is beautiful, isn&rsquo;t she? I had never
      seen her before, though I had a great wish to do so. She fascinated me. I
      could forgive Gania if he were to marry her for love, but for money! Oh
      dear! that is horrible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, your brother does not attract me much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not surprised at that. After what you... But I do hate that way of
      looking at things! Because some fool, or a rogue pretending to be a fool,
      strikes a man, that man is to be dishonoured for his whole life, unless he
      wipes out the disgrace with blood, or makes his assailant beg forgiveness
      on his knees! I think that so very absurd and tyrannical. Lermontoff&rsquo;s Bal
      Masque is based on that idea&mdash;a stupid and unnatural one, in my
      opinion; but he was hardly more than a child when he wrote it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like your sister very much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you see how she spat in Gania&rsquo;s face! Varia is afraid of no one. But
      you did not follow her example, and yet I am sure it was not through
      cowardice. Here she comes! Speak of a wolf and you see his tail! I felt
      sure that she would come. She is very generous, though of course she has
      her faults.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Varia pounced upon her brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is not the place for you,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Go to father. Is he plaguing
      you, prince?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in the least; on the contrary, he interests me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scolding as usual, Varia! It is the worst thing about her. After all, I
      believe father may have started off with Rogojin. No doubt he is sorry
      now. Perhaps I had better go and see what he is doing,&rdquo; added Colia,
      running off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God, I have got mother away, and put her to bed without another
      scene! Gania is worried&mdash;and ashamed&mdash;not without reason! What a
      spectacle! I have come to thank you once more, prince, and to ask you if
      you knew Nastasia Philipovna before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I have never known her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what did you mean, when you said straight out to her that she was
      not really &lsquo;like that&rsquo;? You guessed right, I fancy. It is quite possible
      she was not herself at the moment, though I cannot fathom her meaning.
      Evidently she meant to hurt and insult us. I have heard curious tales
      about her before now, but if she came to invite us to her house, why did
      she behave so to my mother? Ptitsin knows her very well; he says he could
      not understand her today. With Rogojin, too! No one with a spark of
      self-respect could have talked like that in the house of her... Mother is
      extremely vexed on your account, too...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is nothing!&rdquo; said the prince, waving his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how meek she was when you spoke to her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meek! What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You told her it was a shame for her to behave so, and her manner changed
      at once; she was like another person. You have some influence over her,
      prince,&rdquo; added Varia, smiling a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened at this point, and in came Gania most unexpectedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not in the least disconcerted to see Varia there, but he stood a
      moment at the door, and then approached the prince quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prince,&rdquo; he said, with feeling, &ldquo;I was a blackguard. Forgive me!&rdquo; His
      face gave evidence of suffering. The prince was considerably amazed, and
      did not reply at once. &ldquo;Oh, come, forgive me, forgive me!&rdquo; Gania insisted,
      rather impatiently. &ldquo;If you like, I&rsquo;ll kiss your hand. There!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince was touched; he took Gania&rsquo;s hands, and embraced him heartily,
      while each kissed the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never, never thought you were like that,&rdquo; said Muishkin, drawing a deep
      breath. &ldquo;I thought you&mdash;you weren&rsquo;t capable of&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what? Apologizing, eh? And where on earth did I get the idea that you
      were an idiot? You always observe what other people pass by unnoticed; one
      could talk sense to you, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is another to whom you should apologize,&rdquo; said the prince, pointing
      to Varia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! they are all enemies! I&rsquo;ve tried them often enough, believe me,&rdquo;
       and Gania turned his back on Varia with these words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if I beg you to make it up?&rdquo; said Varia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll go to Nastasia Philipovna&rsquo;s this evening&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you insist: but, judge for yourself, can I go, ought I to go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she is not that sort of woman, I tell you!&rdquo; said Gania, angrily. &ldquo;She
      was only acting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that&mdash;I know that; but what a part to play! And think what
      she must take <i>you</i> for, Gania! I know she kissed mother&rsquo;s hand, and
      all that, but she laughed at you, all the same. All this is not good
      enough for seventy-five thousand roubles, my dear boy. You are capable of
      honourable feelings still, and that&rsquo;s why I am talking to you so. Oh! <i>do</i>
      take care what you are doing! Don&rsquo;t you know yourself that it will end
      badly, Gania?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, and in a state of violent agitation, Varia left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, they are all like that,&rdquo; said Gania, laughing, &ldquo;just as if I do
      not know all about it much better than they do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat down with these words, evidently intending to prolong his visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you know it so well,&rdquo; said the prince a little timidly, &ldquo;why do you
      choose all this worry for the sake of the seventy-five thousand, which,
      you confess, does not cover it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean that,&rdquo; said Gania; &ldquo;but while we are upon the subject, let
      me hear your opinion. Is all this worry worth seventy-five thousand or not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course! And it would be a disgrace to marry so, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A great disgrace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, then you may know that I shall certainly do it, now. I shall
      certainly marry her. I was not quite sure of myself before, but now I am.
      Don&rsquo;t say a word: I know what you want to tell me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I was only going to say that what surprises me most of all is your
      extraordinary confidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so? What in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That Nastasia Philipovna will accept you, and that the question is as
      good as settled; and secondly, that even if she did, you would be able to
      pocket the money. Of course, I know very little about it, but that&rsquo;s my
      view. When a man marries for money it often happens that the wife keeps
      the money in her own hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, you don&rsquo;t know all; but, I assure you, you needn&rsquo;t be afraid,
      it won&rsquo;t be like that in our case. There are circumstances,&rdquo; said Gania,
      rather excitedly. &ldquo;And as to her answer to me, there&rsquo;s no doubt about
      that. Why should you suppose she will refuse me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I only judge by what I see. Varvara Ardalionovna said just now&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh she&mdash;they don&rsquo;t know anything about it! Nastasia was only
      chaffing Rogojin. I was alarmed at first, but I have thought better of it
      now; she was simply laughing at him. She looks on me as a fool because I
      show that I meant her money, and doesn&rsquo;t realize that there are other men
      who would deceive her in far worse fashion. I&rsquo;m not going to pretend
      anything, and you&rsquo;ll see she&rsquo;ll marry me, all right. If she likes to live
      quietly, so she shall; but if she gives me any of her nonsense, I shall
      leave her at once, but I shall keep the money. I&rsquo;m not going to look a
      fool; that&rsquo;s the first thing, not to look a fool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Nastasia Philipovna seems to me to be such a <i>sensible</i> woman,
      and, as such, why should she run blindly into this business? That&rsquo;s what
      puzzles me so,&rdquo; said the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know all, you see; I tell you there are things&mdash;and
      besides, I&rsquo;m sure that she is persuaded that I love her to distraction,
      and I give you my word I have a strong suspicion that she loves me, too&mdash;in
      her own way, of course. She thinks she will be able to make a sort of
      slave of me all my life; but I shall prepare a little surprise for her. I
      don&rsquo;t know whether I ought to be confidential with you, prince; but, I
      assure you, you are the only decent fellow I have come across. I have not
      spoken so sincerely as I am doing at this moment for years. There are
      uncommonly few honest people about, prince; there isn&rsquo;t one honester than
      Ptitsin, he&rsquo;s the best of the lot. Are you laughing? You don&rsquo;t know,
      perhaps, that blackguards like honest people, and being one myself I like
      you. <i>Why</i> am I a blackguard? Tell me honestly, now. They all call me
      a blackguard because of her, and I have got into the way of thinking
      myself one. That&rsquo;s what is so bad about the business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> for one shall never think you a blackguard again,&rdquo; said the
      prince. &ldquo;I confess I had a poor opinion of you at first, but I have been
      so joyfully surprised about you just now; it&rsquo;s a good lesson for me. I
      shall never judge again without a thorough trial. I see now that you are
      not only not a blackguard, but are not even quite spoiled. I see that you
      are quite an ordinary man, not original in the least degree, but rather
      weak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gania laughed sarcastically, but said nothing. The prince, seeing that he
      did not quite like the last remark, blushed, and was silent too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has my father asked you for money?&rdquo; asked Gania, suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give it to him if he does. Fancy, he was a decent, respectable man
      once! He was received in the best society; he was not always the liar he
      is now. Of course, wine is at the bottom of it all; but he is a good deal
      worse than an innocent liar now. Do you know that he keeps a mistress? I
      can&rsquo;t understand how mother is so long-suffering. Did he tell you the
      story of the siege of Kars? Or perhaps the one about his grey horse that
      talked? He loves to enlarge on these absurd histories.&rdquo; And Gania burst
      into a fit of laughter. Suddenly he turned to the prince and asked: &ldquo;Why
      are you looking at me like that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am surprised to see you laugh in that way, like a child. You came to
      make friends with me again just now, and you said, &lsquo;I will kiss your hand,
      if you like,&rsquo; just as a child would have said it. And then, all at once
      you are talking of this mad project&mdash;of these seventy-five thousand
      roubles! It all seems so absurd and impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what conclusion have you reached?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you are rushing madly into the undertaking, and that you would do
      well to think it over again. It is more than possible that Varvara
      Ardalionovna is right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! now you begin to moralize! I know that I am only a child, very well,&rdquo;
       replied Gania impatiently. &ldquo;That is proved by my having this conversation
      with you. It is not for money only, prince, that I am rushing into this
      affair,&rdquo; he continued, hardly master of his words, so closely had his
      vanity been touched. &ldquo;If I reckoned on that I should certainly be
      deceived, for I am still too weak in mind and character. I am obeying a
      passion, an impulse perhaps, because I have but one aim, one that
      overmasters all else. You imagine that once I am in possession of these
      seventy-five thousand roubles, I shall rush to buy a carriage... No, I
      shall go on wearing the old overcoat I have worn for three years, and I
      shall give up my club. I shall follow the example of men who have made
      their fortunes. When Ptitsin was seventeen he slept in the street, he sold
      pen-knives, and began with a copeck; now he has sixty thousand roubles,
      but to get them, what has he not done? Well, I shall be spared such a hard
      beginning, and shall start with a little capital. In fifteen years people
      will say, &lsquo;Look, that&rsquo;s Ivolgin, the king of the Jews!&rsquo; You say that I
      have no originality. Now mark this, prince&mdash;there is nothing so
      offensive to a man of our time and race than to be told that he is wanting
      in originality, that he is weak in character, has no particular talent,
      and is, in short, an ordinary person. You have not even done me the honour
      of looking upon me as a rogue. Do you know, I could have knocked you down
      for that just now! You wounded me more cruelly than Epanchin, who thinks
      me capable of selling him my wife! Observe, it was a perfectly gratuitous
      idea on his part, seeing there has never been any discussion of it between
      us! This has exasperated me, and I am determined to make a fortune! I will
      do it! Once I am rich, I shall be a genius, an extremely original man. One
      of the vilest and most hateful things connected with money is that it can
      buy even talent; and will do so as long as the world lasts. You will say
      that this is childish&mdash;or romantic. Well, that will be all the better
      for me, but the thing shall be done. I will carry it through. He laughs
      most, who laughs last. Why does Epanchin insult me? Simply because,
      socially, I am a nobody. However, enough for the present. Colia has put
      his nose in to tell us dinner is ready, twice. I&rsquo;m dining out. I shall
      come and talk to you now and then; you shall be comfortable enough with
      us. They are sure to make you one of the family. I think you and I will
      either be great friends or enemies. Look here now, supposing I had kissed
      your hand just now, as I offered to do in all sincerity, should I have
      hated you for it afterwards?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, but not always. You would not have been able to keep it up,
      and would have ended by forgiving me,&rdquo; said the prince, after a pause for
      reflection, and with a pleasant smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oho, how careful one has to be with you, prince! Haven&rsquo;t you put a drop
      of poison in that remark now, eh? By the way&mdash;ha, ha, ha!&mdash;I
      forgot to ask, was I right in believing that you were a good deal struck
      yourself with Nastasia Philipovna.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye-yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you in love with her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N-no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet you flush up as red as a rosebud! Come&mdash;it&rsquo;s all right. I&rsquo;m
      not going to laugh at you. Do you know she is a very virtuous woman?
      Believe it or not, as you like. You think she and Totski&mdash;not a bit
      of it, not a bit of it! Not for ever so long! <i>Au revoir!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gania left the room in great good humour. The prince stayed behind, and
      meditated alone for a few minutes. At length, Colia popped his head in
      once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want any dinner, thanks, Colia. I had too good a lunch at General
      Epanchin&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colia came into the room and gave the prince a note; it was from the
      general and was carefully sealed up. It was clear from Colia&rsquo;s face how
      painful it was to him to deliver the missive. The prince read it, rose,
      and took his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a couple of yards,&rdquo; said Colia, blushing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s sitting there over his bottle&mdash;and how they can give him
      credit, I cannot understand. Don&rsquo;t tell mother I brought you the note,
      prince; I have sworn not to do it a thousand times, but I&rsquo;m always so
      sorry for him. Don&rsquo;t stand on ceremony, give him some trifle, and let that
      end it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along, Colia, I want to see your father. I have an idea,&rdquo; said the
      prince.
    </p>
    <h3>
      XII.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Colia took the prince to a public-house in the Litaynaya, not far off. In
      one of the side rooms there sat at a table&mdash;looking like one of the
      regular guests of the establishment&mdash;Ardalion Alexandrovitch, with a
      bottle before him, and a newspaper on his knee. He was waiting for the
      prince, and no sooner did the latter appear than he began a long harangue
      about something or other; but so far gone was he that the prince could
      hardly understand a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not got a ten-rouble note,&rdquo; said the prince; &ldquo;but here is a
      twenty-five. Change it and give me back the fifteen, or I shall be left
      without a farthing myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, of course, of course; and you quite understand that I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and I have another request to make, general. Have you ever been at
      Nastasia Philipovna&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? I? Do you mean me? Often, my friend, often! I only pretended I had not
      in order to avoid a painful subject. You saw today, you were a witness,
      that I did all that a kind, an indulgent father could do. Now a father of
      altogether another type shall step into the scene. You shall see; the old
      soldier shall lay bare this intrigue, or a shameless woman will force her
      way into a respectable and noble family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, quite so. I wished to ask you whether you could show me the way to
      Nastasia Philipovna&rsquo;s tonight. I must go; I have business with her; I was
      not invited but I was introduced. Anyhow I am ready to trespass the laws
      of propriety if only I can get in somehow or other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear young friend, you have hit on my very idea. It was not for this
      rubbish I asked you to come over here&rdquo; (he pocketed the money, however, at
      this point), &ldquo;it was to invite your alliance in the campaign against
      Nastasia Philipovna tonight. How well it sounds, &lsquo;General Ivolgin and
      Prince Muishkin.&rsquo; That&rsquo;ll fetch her, I think, eh? Capital! We&rsquo;ll go at
      nine; there&rsquo;s time yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where does she live?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, a long way off, near the Great Theatre, just in the square there&mdash;It
      won&rsquo;t be a large party.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The general sat on and on. He had ordered a fresh bottle when the prince
      arrived; this took him an hour to drink, and then he had another, and
      another, during the consumption of which he told pretty nearly the whole
      story of his life. The prince was in despair. He felt that though he had
      but applied to this miserable old drunkard because he saw no other way of
      getting to Nastasia Philipovna&rsquo;s, yet he had been very wrong to put the
      slightest confidence in such a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he rose and declared that he would wait no longer. The general
      rose too, drank the last drops that he could squeeze out of the bottle,
      and staggered into the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Muishkin began to despair. He could not imagine how he had been so foolish
      as to trust this man. He only wanted one thing, and that was to get to
      Nastasia Philipovna&rsquo;s, even at the cost of a certain amount of
      impropriety. But now the scandal threatened to be more than he had
      bargained for. By this time Ardalion Alexandrovitch was quite intoxicated,
      and he kept his companion listening while he discoursed eloquently and
      pathetically on subjects of all kinds, interspersed with torrents of
      recrimination against the members of his family. He insisted that all his
      troubles were caused by their bad conduct, and time alone would put an end
      to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last they reached the Litaynaya. The thaw increased steadily, a warm,
      unhealthy wind blew through the streets, vehicles splashed through the
      mud, and the iron shoes of horses and mules rang on the paving stones.
      Crowds of melancholy people plodded wearily along the footpaths, with here
      and there a drunken man among them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you see those brightly-lighted windows?&rdquo; said the general. &ldquo;Many of my
      old comrades-in-arms live about here, and I, who served longer, and
      suffered more than any of them, am walking on foot to the house of a woman
      of rather questionable reputation! A man, look you, who has thirteen
      bullets on his breast!... You don&rsquo;t believe it? Well, I can assure you it
      was entirely on my account that Pirogoff telegraphed to Paris, and left
      Sebastopol at the greatest risk during the siege. Nelaton, the Tuileries
      surgeon, demanded a safe conduct, in the name of science, into the
      besieged city in order to attend my wounds. The government knows all about
      it. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the Ivolgin with thirteen bullets in him!&rsquo; That&rsquo;s how they
      speak of me.... Do you see that house, prince? One of my old friends lives
      on the first floor, with his large family. In this and five other houses,
      three overlooking Nevsky, two in the Morskaya, are all that remain of my
      personal friends. Nina Alexandrovna gave them up long ago, but I keep in
      touch with them still... I may say I find refreshment in this little
      coterie, in thus meeting my old acquaintances and subordinates, who
      worship me still, in spite of all. General Sokolovitch (by the way, I have
      not called on him lately, or seen Anna Fedorovna)... You know, my dear
      prince, when a person does not receive company himself, he gives up going
      to other people&rsquo;s houses involuntarily. And yet... well... you look as if
      you didn&rsquo;t believe me.... Well now, why should I not present the son of my
      old friend and companion to this delightful family&mdash;General Ivolgin
      and Prince Muishkin? You will see a lovely girl&mdash;what am I saying&mdash;a
      lovely girl? No, indeed, two, three! Ornaments of this city and of
      society: beauty, education, culture&mdash;the woman question&mdash;poetry&mdash;everything!
      Added to which is the fact that each one will have a dot of at least
      eighty thousand roubles. No bad thing, eh?... In a word I absolutely must
      introduce you to them: it is a duty, an obligation. General Ivolgin and
      Prince Muishkin. Tableau!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At once? Now? You must have forgotten...&rdquo; began the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I have forgotten nothing. Come! This is the house&mdash;up this
      magnificent staircase. I am surprised not to see the porter, but .... it
      is a holiday... and the man has gone off... Drunken fool! Why have they
      not got rid of him? Sokolovitch owes all the happiness he has had in the
      service and in his private life to me, and me alone, but... here we are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince followed quietly, making no further objection for fear of
      irritating the old man. At the same time he fervently hoped that General
      Sokolovitch and his family would fade away like a mirage in the desert, so
      that the visitors could escape, by merely returning downstairs. But to his
      horror he saw that General Ivolgin was quite familiar with the house, and
      really seemed to have friends there. At every step he named some
      topographical or biographical detail that left nothing to be desired on
      the score of accuracy. When they arrived at last, on the first floor, and
      the general turned to ring the bell to the right, the prince decided to
      run away, but a curious incident stopped him momentarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have made a mistake, general,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;The name on the door is
      Koulakoff, and you were going to see General Sokolovitch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Koulakoff... Koulakoff means nothing. This is Sokolovitch&rsquo;s flat, and I
      am ringing at his door.... What do I care for Koulakoff?... Here comes
      someone to open.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In fact, the door opened directly, and the footman informed the visitors
      that the family were all away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a pity! What a pity! It&rsquo;s just my luck!&rdquo; repeated Ardalion
      Alexandrovitch over and over again, in regretful tones. &ldquo;When your master
      and mistress return, my man, tell them that General Ivolgin and Prince
      Muishkin desired to present themselves, and that they were extremely
      sorry, excessively grieved...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then another person belonging to the household was seen at the back
      of the hall. It was a woman of some forty years, dressed in sombre
      colours, probably a housekeeper or a governess. Hearing the names she came
      forward with a look of suspicion on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marie Alexandrovna is not at home,&rdquo; said she, staring hard at the
      general. &ldquo;She has gone to her mother&rsquo;s, with Alexandra Michailovna.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alexandra Michailovna out, too! How disappointing! Would you believe it,
      I am always so unfortunate! May I most respectfully ask you to present my
      compliments to Alexandra Michailovna, and remind her... tell her, that
      with my whole heart I wish for her what she wished for herself on Thursday
      evening, while she was listening to Chopin&rsquo;s Ballade. She will remember. I
      wish it with all sincerity. General Ivolgin and Prince Muishkin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman&rsquo;s face changed; she lost her suspicious expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not fail to deliver your message,&rdquo; she replied, and bowed them
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they went downstairs the general regretted repeatedly that he had
      failed to introduce the prince to his friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know I am a bit of a poet,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Have you noticed it? The poetic
      soul, you know.&rdquo; Then he added suddenly&mdash;&ldquo;But after all... after all
      I believe we made a mistake this time! I remember that the Sokolovitch&rsquo;s
      live in another house, and what is more, they are just now in Moscow. Yes,
      I certainly was at fault. However, it is of no consequence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just tell me,&rdquo; said the prince in reply, &ldquo;may I count still on your
      assistance? Or shall I go on alone to see Nastasia Philipovna?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Count on my assistance? Go alone? How can you ask me that question, when
      it is a matter on which the fate of my family so largely depends? You
      don&rsquo;t know Ivolgin, my friend. To trust Ivolgin is to trust a rock; that&rsquo;s
      how the first squadron I commanded spoke of me. &lsquo;Depend upon Ivolgin,&rsquo;
      said they all, &lsquo;he is as steady as a rock.&rsquo; But, excuse me, I must just
      call at a house on our way, a house where I have found consolation and
      help in all my trials for years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No... I wish... to visit Madame Terentieff, the widow of Captain
      Terentieff, my old subordinate and friend. She helps me to keep up my
      courage, and to bear the trials of my domestic life, and as I have an
      extra burden on my mind today...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; interrupted the prince, &ldquo;that I was foolish to trouble
      you just now. However, at present you... Good-bye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, you must not go away like that, young man, you must not!&rdquo; cried
      the general. &ldquo;My friend here is a widow, the mother of a family; her words
      come straight from her heart, and find an echo in mine. A visit to her is
      merely an affair of a few minutes; I am quite at home in her house. I will
      have a wash, and dress, and then we can drive to the Grand Theatre. Make
      up your mind to spend the evening with me.... We are just there&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      the house... Why, Colia! you here! Well, is Marfa Borisovna at home or
      have you only just come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no! I have been here a long while,&rdquo; replied Colia, who was at the
      front door when the general met him. &ldquo;I am keeping Hippolyte company. He
      is worse, and has been in bed all day. I came down to buy some cards.
      Marfa Borisovna expects you. But what a state you are in, father!&rdquo; added
      the boy, noticing his father&rsquo;s unsteady gait. &ldquo;Well, let us go in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On meeting Colia the prince determined to accompany the general, though he
      made up his mind to stay as short a time as possible. He wanted Colia, but
      firmly resolved to leave the general behind. He could not forgive himself
      for being so simple as to imagine that Ivolgin would be of any use. The
      three climbed up the long staircase until they reached the fourth floor
      where Madame Terentieff lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You intend to introduce the prince?&rdquo; asked Colia, as they went up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my boy. I wish to present him: General Ivolgin and Prince Muishkin!
      But what&rsquo;s the matter?... what?... How is Marfa Borisovna?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, father, you would have done much better not to come at all! She
      is ready to eat you up! You have not shown yourself since the day before
      yesterday and she is expecting the money. Why did you promise her any? You
      are always the same! Well, now you will have to get out of it as best you
      can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They stopped before a somewhat low doorway on the fourth floor. Ardalion
      Alexandrovitch, evidently much out of countenance, pushed Muishkin in
      front.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will wait here,&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;I should like to surprise her. ....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colia entered first, and as the door stood open, the mistress of the house
      peeped out. The surprise of the general&rsquo;s imagination fell very flat, for
      she at once began to address him in terms of reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marfa Borisovna was about forty years of age. She wore a dressing-jacket,
      her feet were in slippers, her face painted, and her hair was in dozens of
      small plaits. No sooner did she catch sight of Ardalion Alexandrovitch
      than she screamed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There he is, that wicked, mean wretch! I knew it was he! My heart misgave
      me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man tried to put a good face on the affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, let us go in&mdash;it&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he whispered in the prince&rsquo;s
      ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was more serious than he wished to think. As soon as the visitors
      had crossed the low dark hall, and entered the narrow reception-room,
      furnished with half a dozen cane chairs, and two small card-tables, Madame
      Terentieff, in the shrill tones habitual to her, continued her stream of
      invectives.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you not ashamed? Are you not ashamed? You barbarian! You tyrant! You
      have robbed me of all I possessed&mdash;you have sucked my bones to the
      marrow. How long shall I be your victim? Shameless, dishonourable man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marfa Borisovna! Marfa Borisovna! Here is... the Prince Muishkin! General
      Ivolgin and Prince Muishkin,&rdquo; stammered the disconcerted old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you believe,&rdquo; said the mistress of the house, suddenly addressing
      the prince, &ldquo;would you believe that that man has not even spared my orphan
      children? He has stolen everything I possessed, sold everything, pawned
      everything; he has left me nothing&mdash;nothing! What am I to do with
      your IOU&rsquo;s, you cunning, unscrupulous rogue? Answer, devourer! answer,
      heart of stone! How shall I feed my orphans? with what shall I nourish
      them? And now he has come, he is drunk! He can scarcely stand. How, oh
      how, have I offended the Almighty, that He should bring this curse upon
      me! Answer, you worthless villain, answer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But this was too much for the general.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here are twenty-five roubles, Marfa Borisovna... it is all that I can
      give... and I owe even these to the prince&rsquo;s generosity&mdash;my noble
      friend. I have been cruelly deceived. Such is... life... Now... Excuse me,
      I am very weak,&rdquo; he continued, standing in the centre of the room, and
      bowing to all sides. &ldquo;I am faint; excuse me! Lenotchka... a cushion... my
      dear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lenotchka, a little girl of eight, ran to fetch the cushion at once, and
      placed it on the rickety old sofa. The general meant to have said much
      more, but as soon as he had stretched himself out, he turned his face to
      the wall, and slept the sleep of the just.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a grave and ceremonious air, Marfa Borisovna motioned the prince to a
      chair at one of the card-tables. She seated herself opposite, leaned her
      right cheek on her hand, and sat in silence, her eyes fixed on Muishkin,
      now and again sighing deeply. The three children, two little girls and a
      boy, Lenotchka being the eldest, came and leant on the table and also
      stared steadily at him. Presently Colia appeared from the adjoining room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very glad indeed to have met you here, Colia,&rdquo; said the prince. &ldquo;Can
      you do something for me? I must see Nastasia Philipovna, and I asked
      Ardalion Alexandrovitch just now to take me to her house, but he has gone
      to sleep, as you see. Will you show me the way, for I do not know the
      street? I have the address, though; it is close to the Grand Theatre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nastasia Philipovna? She does not live there, and to tell you the truth
      my father has never been to her house! It is strange that you should have
      depended on him! She lives near Wladimir Street, at the Five Corners, and
      it is quite close by. Will you go directly? It is just half-past nine. I
      will show you the way with pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colia and the prince went off together. Alas! the latter had no money to
      pay for a cab, so they were obliged to walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have liked to have taken you to see Hippolyte,&rdquo; said Colia. &ldquo;He
      is the eldest son of the lady you met just now, and was in the next room.
      He is ill, and has been in bed all day. But he is rather strange, and
      extremely sensitive, and I thought he might be upset considering the
      circumstances in which you came... Somehow it touches me less, as it
      concerns my father, while it is <i>his</i> mother. That, of course, makes
      a great difference. What is a terrible disgrace to a woman, does not
      disgrace a man, at least not in the same way. Perhaps public opinion is
      wrong in condemning one sex, and excusing the other. Hippolyte is an
      extremely clever boy, but so prejudiced. He is really a slave to his
      opinions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you say he is consumptive?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. It really would be happier for him to die young. If I were in his
      place I should certainly long for death. He is unhappy about his brother
      and sisters, the children you saw. If it were possible, if we only had a
      little money, we should leave our respective families, and live together
      in a little apartment of our own. It is our dream. But, do you know, when
      I was talking over your affair with him, he was angry, and said that
      anyone who did not call out a man who had given him a blow was a coward.
      He is very irritable to-day, and I left off arguing the matter with him.
      So Nastasia Philipovna has invited you to go and see her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To tell the truth, she has not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then how do you come to be going there?&rdquo; cried Colia, so much astonished
      that he stopped short in the middle of the pavement. &ldquo;And... and are you
      going to her &lsquo;At Home&rsquo; in that costume?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, really, whether I shall be allowed in at all. If she will
      receive me, so much the better. If not, the matter is ended. As to my
      clothes&mdash;what can I do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going there for some particular reason, or only as a way of
      getting into her society, and that of her friends?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I have really an object in going... That is, I am going on business
      it is difficult to explain, but...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, whether you go on business or not is your affair, I do not want to
      know. The only important thing, in my eyes, is that you should not be
      going there simply for the pleasure of spending your evening in such
      company&mdash;cocottes, generals, usurers! If that were the case I should
      despise and laugh at you. There are terribly few honest people here, and
      hardly any whom one can respect, although people put on airs&mdash;Varia
      especially! Have you noticed, prince, how many adventurers there are
      nowadays? Especially here, in our dear Russia. How it has happened I never
      can understand. There used to be a certain amount of solidity in all
      things, but now what happens? Everything is exposed to the public gaze,
      veils are thrown back, every wound is probed by careless fingers. We are
      for ever present at an orgy of scandalous revelations. Parents blush when
      they remember their old-fashioned morality. At Moscow lately a father was
      heard urging his son to stop at nothing&mdash;at nothing, mind you!&mdash;to
      get money! The press seized upon the story, of course, and now it is
      public property. Look at my father, the general! See what he is, and yet,
      I assure you, he is an honest man! Only... he drinks too much, and his
      morals are not all we could desire. Yes, that&rsquo;s true! I pity him, to tell
      the truth, but I dare not say so, because everybody would laugh at me&mdash;but
      I do pity him! And who are the really clever men, after all?
      Money-grubbers, every one of them, from the first to the last. Hippolyte
      finds excuses for money-lending, and says it is a necessity. He talks
      about the economic movement, and the ebb and flow of capital; the devil
      knows what he means. It makes me angry to hear him talk so, but he is
      soured by his troubles. Just imagine&mdash;the general keeps his mother&mdash;but she
      lends him money! She lends it for a week or ten days at very high
      interest! Isn&rsquo;t it disgusting? And then, you would hardly believe it, but
      my mother&mdash;Nina Alexandrovna&mdash;helps Hippolyte in all sorts of
      ways, sends him money and clothes. She even goes as far as helping the
      children, through Hippolyte, because their mother cares nothing about
      them, and Varia does the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, just now you said there were no honest nor good people about, that
      there were only money-grubbers&mdash;and here they are quite close at
      hand, these honest and good people, your mother and Varia! I think there
      is a good deal of moral strength in helping people in such circumstances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Varia does it from pride, and likes showing off, and giving herself airs.
      As to my mother, I really do admire her&mdash;yes, and honour her.
      Hippolyte, hardened as he is, feels it. He laughed at first, and thought
      it vulgar of her&mdash;but now, he is sometimes quite touched and overcome
      by her kindness. H&rsquo;m! You call that being strong and good? I will remember
      that! Gania knows nothing about it. He would say that it was encouraging
      vice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Gania knows nothing about it? It seems there are many things that
      Gania does not know,&rdquo; exclaimed the prince, as he considered Colia&rsquo;s last
      words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, I like you very much indeed, prince? I shall never forget
      about this afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like you too, Colia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me! You are going to live here, are you not?&rdquo; said Colia. &ldquo;I
      mean to get something to do directly, and earn money. Then shall we three
      live together? You, and I, and Hippolyte? We will hire a flat, and let the
      general come and visit us. What do you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be very pleasant,&rdquo; returned the prince. &ldquo;But we must see. I am
      really rather worried just now. What! are we there already? Is that the
      house? What a long flight of steps! And there&rsquo;s a porter! Well, Colia I
      don&rsquo;t know what will come of it all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince seemed quite distracted for the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must tell me all about it tomorrow! Don&rsquo;t be afraid. I wish you
      success; we agree so entirely that I can do so, although I do not
      understand why you are here. Good-bye!&rdquo; cried Colia excitedly. &ldquo;Now I will
      rush back and tell Hippolyte all about our plans and proposals! But as to
      your getting in&mdash;don&rsquo;t be in the least afraid. You will see her. She
      is so original about everything. It&rsquo;s the first floor. The porter will
      show you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <h3>
      XIII.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The prince was very nervous as he reached the outer door; but he did his
      best to encourage himself with the reflection that the worst thing that
      could happen to him would be that he would not be received, or, perhaps,
      received, then laughed at for coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was another question, which terrified him considerably, and that
      was: what was he going to do when he <i>did</i> get in? And to this
      question he could fashion no satisfactory reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      If only he could find an opportunity of coming close up to Nastasia
      Philipovna and saying to her: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ruin yourself by marrying this man.
      He does not love you, he only loves your money. He told me so himself, and
      so did Aglaya Ivanovna, and I have come on purpose to warn you&rdquo;&mdash;but
      even that did not seem quite a legitimate or practicable thing to do.
      Then, again, there was another delicate question, to which he could not
      find an answer; dared not, in fact, think of it; but at the very idea of
      which he trembled and blushed. However, in spite of all his fears and
      heart-quakings he went in, and asked for Nastasia Philipovna.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nastasia occupied a medium-sized, but distinctly tasteful, flat,
      beautifully furnished and arranged. At one period of these five years of
      Petersburg life, Totski had certainly not spared his expenditure upon her.
      He had calculated upon her eventual love, and tried to tempt her with a
      lavish outlay upon comforts and luxuries, knowing too well how easily the
      heart accustoms itself to comforts, and how difficult it is to tear one&rsquo;s
      self away from luxuries which have become habitual and, little by little,
      indispensable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nastasia did not reject all this, she even loved her comforts and
      luxuries, but, strangely enough, never became, in the least degree,
      dependent upon them, and always gave the impression that she could do just
      as well without them. In fact, she went so far as to inform Totski on
      several occasions that such was the case, which the latter gentleman
      considered a very unpleasant communication indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, of late, Totski had observed many strange and original features and
      characteristics in Nastasia, which he had neither known nor reckoned upon
      in former times, and some of these fascinated him, even now, in spite of
      the fact that all his old calculations with regard to her were long ago
      cast to the winds.
    </p>
    <p>
      A maid opened the door for the prince (Nastasia&rsquo;s servants were all
      females) and, to his surprise, received his request to announce him to her
      mistress without any astonishment. Neither his dirty boots, nor his
      wide-brimmed hat, nor his sleeveless cloak, nor his evident confusion of
      manner, produced the least impression upon her. She helped him off with
      his cloak, and begged him to wait a moment in the ante-room while she
      announced him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The company assembled at Nastasia Philipovna&rsquo;s consisted of none but her
      most intimate friends, and formed a very small party in comparison with
      her usual gatherings on this anniversary.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first place there were present Totski, and General Epanchin. They
      were both highly amiable, but both appeared to be labouring under a
      half-hidden feeling of anxiety as to the result of Nastasia&rsquo;s
      deliberations with regard to Gania, which result was to be made public
      this evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, of course, there was Gania who was by no means so amiable as his
      elders, but stood apart, gloomy, and miserable, and silent. He had
      determined not to bring Varia with him; but Nastasia had not even asked
      after her, though no sooner had he arrived than she had reminded him of
      the episode between himself and the prince. The general, who had heard
      nothing of it before, began to listen with some interest, while Gania,
      drily, but with perfect candour, went through the whole history, including
      the fact of his apology to the prince. He finished by declaring that the
      prince was a most extraordinary man, and goodness knows why he had been
      considered an idiot hitherto, for he was very far from being one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nastasia listened to all this with great interest; but the conversation
      soon turned to Rogojin and his visit, and this theme proved of the
      greatest attraction to both Totski and the general.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ptitsin was able to afford some particulars as to Rogojin&rsquo;s conduct since
      the afternoon. He declared that he had been busy finding money for the
      latter ever since, and up to nine o&rsquo;clock, Rogojin having declared that he
      must absolutely have a hundred thousand roubles by the evening. He added
      that Rogojin was drunk, of course; but that he thought the money would be
      forthcoming, for the excited and intoxicated rapture of the fellow
      impelled him to give any interest or premium that was asked of him, and
      there were several others engaged in beating up the money, also.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this news was received by the company with somewhat gloomy interest.
      Nastasia was silent, and would not say what she thought about it. Gania
      was equally uncommunicative. The general seemed the most anxious of all,
      and decidedly uneasy. The present of pearls which he had prepared with so
      much joy in the morning had been accepted but coldly, and Nastasia had
      smiled rather disagreeably as she took it from him. Ferdishenko was the
      only person present in good spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Totski himself, who had the reputation of being a capital talker, and was
      usually the life and soul of these entertainments, was as silent as any on
      this occasion, and sat in a state of, for him, most uncommon perturbation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest of the guests (an old tutor or schoolmaster, goodness knows why
      invited; a young man, very timid, and shy and silent; a rather loud woman
      of about forty, apparently an actress; and a very pretty, well-dressed
      German lady who hardly said a word all the evening) not only had no gift
      for enlivening the proceedings, but hardly knew what to say for themselves
      when addressed. Under these circumstances the arrival of the prince came
      almost as a godsend.
    </p>
    <p>
      The announcement of his name gave rise to some surprise and to some
      smiles, especially when it became evident, from Nastasia&rsquo;s astonished
      look, that she had not thought of inviting him. But her astonishment once
      over, Nastasia showed such satisfaction that all prepared to greet the
      prince with cordial smiles of welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; remarked General Epanchin, &ldquo;he does this out of pure
      innocence. It&rsquo;s a little dangerous, perhaps, to encourage this sort of
      freedom; but it is rather a good thing that he has arrived just at this
      moment. He may enliven us a little with his originalities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Especially as he asked himself,&rdquo; said Ferdishenko.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that got to do with it?&rdquo; asked the general, who loathed
      Ferdishenko.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, he must pay toll for his entrance,&rdquo; explained the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m! Prince Muishkin is not Ferdishenko,&rdquo; said the general, impatiently.
      This worthy gentleman could never quite reconcile himself to the idea of
      meeting Ferdishenko in society, and on an equal footing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh general, spare Ferdishenko!&rdquo; replied the other, smiling. &ldquo;I have
      special privileges.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by special privileges?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once before I had the honour of stating them to the company. I will
      repeat the explanation to-day for your excellency&rsquo;s benefit. You see,
      excellency, all the world is witty and clever except myself. I am neither.
      As a kind of compensation I am allowed to tell the truth, for it is a
      well-known fact that only stupid people tell &lsquo;the truth.&rsquo; Added to this, I
      am a spiteful man, just because I am not clever. If I am offended or
      injured I bear it quite patiently until the man injuring me meets with
      some misfortune. Then I remember, and take my revenge. I return the injury
      sevenfold, as Ivan Petrovitch Ptitsin says. (Of course he never does so
      himself.) Excellency, no doubt you recollect Kryloff&rsquo;s fable, &lsquo;The Lion
      and the Ass&rsquo;? Well now, that&rsquo;s you and I. That fable was written precisely
      for us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to be talking nonsense again, Ferdishenko,&rdquo; growled the general.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter, excellency? I know how to keep my place. When I said
      just now that we, you and I, were the lion and the ass of Kryloff&rsquo;s fable,
      of course it is understood that I take the role of the ass. Your
      excellency is the lion of which the fable remarks:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;A mighty lion, terror of the woods,
   Was shorn of his great prowess by old age.&rsquo;
</pre>
    <p>
      And I, your excellency, am the ass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am of your opinion on that last point,&rdquo; said Ivan Fedorovitch, with
      ill-concealed irritation.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this was no doubt extremely coarse, and moreover it was premeditated,
      but after all Ferdishenko had persuaded everyone to accept him as a
      buffoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I am admitted and tolerated here,&rdquo; he had said one day, &ldquo;it is simply
      because I talk in this way. How can anyone possibly receive such a man as
      I am? I quite understand. Now, could I, a Ferdishenko, be allowed to sit
      shoulder to shoulder with a clever man like Afanasy Ivanovitch? There is
      one explanation, only one. I am given the position because it is so
      entirely inconceivable!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But these vulgarities seemed to please Nastasia Philipovna, although too
      often they were both rude and offensive. Those who wished to go to her
      house were forced to put up with Ferdishenko. Possibly the latter was not
      mistaken in imagining that he was received simply in order to annoy
      Totski, who disliked him extremely. Gania also was often made the butt of
      the jester&rsquo;s sarcasms, who used this method of keeping in Nastasia
      Philipovna&rsquo;s good graces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The prince will begin by singing us a fashionable ditty,&rdquo; remarked
      Ferdishenko, and looked at the mistress of the house, to see what she
      would say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so, Ferdishenko; please be quiet,&rdquo; answered Nastasia
      Philipovna dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A-ah! if he is to be under special patronage, I withdraw my claws.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Nastasia Philipovna had now risen and advanced to meet the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was so sorry to have forgotten to ask you to come, when I saw you,&rdquo; she
      said, &ldquo;and I am delighted to be able to thank you personally now, and to
      express my pleasure at your resolution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying she gazed into his eyes, longing to see whether she could make
      any guess as to the explanation of his motive in coming to her house. The
      prince would very likely have made some reply to her kind words, but he
      was so dazzled by her appearance that he could not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nastasia noticed this with satisfaction. She was in full dress this
      evening; and her appearance was certainly calculated to impress all
      beholders. She took his hand and led him towards her other guests. But
      just before they reached the drawing-room door, the prince stopped her,
      and hurriedly and in great agitation whispered to her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are altogether perfection; even your pallor and thinness are perfect;
      one could not wish you otherwise. I did so wish to come and see you. I&mdash;forgive
      me, please&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t apologize,&rdquo; said Nastasia, laughing; &ldquo;you spoil the whole
      originality of the thing. I think what they say about you must be true,
      that you are so original.&mdash;So you think me perfection, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m! Well, you may be a good reader of riddles but you are wrong <i>there</i>,
      at all events. I&rsquo;ll remind you of this, tonight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nastasia introduced the prince to her guests, to most of whom he was
      already known.
    </p>
    <p>
      Totski immediately made some amiable remark. All seemed to brighten up at
      once, and the conversation became general. Nastasia made the prince sit
      down next to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me, there&rsquo;s nothing so very curious about the prince dropping in,
      after all,&rdquo; remarked Ferdishenko.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite a clear case,&rdquo; said the hitherto silent Gania. &ldquo;I have watched
      the prince almost all day, ever since the moment when he first saw
      Nastasia Philipovna&rsquo;s portrait, at General Epanchin&rsquo;s. I remember thinking
      at the time what I am now pretty sure of; and what, I may say in passing,
      the prince confessed to myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gania said all this perfectly seriously, and without the slightest
      appearance of joking; indeed, he seemed strangely gloomy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not confess anything to you,&rdquo; said the prince, blushing. &ldquo;I only
      answered your question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo! That&rsquo;s frank, at any rate!&rdquo; shouted Ferdishenko, and there was
      general laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh prince, prince! I never should have thought it of you;&rdquo; said General
      Epanchin. &ldquo;And I imagined you a philosopher! Oh, you silent fellows!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judging from the fact that the prince blushed at this innocent joke, like
      a young girl, I should think that he must, as an honourable man, harbour
      the noblest intentions,&rdquo; said the old toothless schoolmaster, most
      unexpectedly; he had not so much as opened his mouth before. This remark
      provoked general mirth, and the old fellow himself laughed loudest of the
      lot, but ended with a stupendous fit of coughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nastasia Philipovna, who loved originality and drollery of all kinds, was
      apparently very fond of this old man, and rang the bell for more tea to
      stop his coughing. It was now half-past ten o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, wouldn&rsquo;t you like a little champagne now?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I have
      it all ready; it will cheer us up&mdash;do now&mdash;no ceremony!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This invitation to drink, couched, as it was, in such informal terms, came
      very strangely from Nastasia Philipovna. Her usual entertainments were not
      quite like this; there was more style about them. However, the wine was
      not refused; each guest took a glass excepting Gania, who drank nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was extremely difficult to account for Nastasia&rsquo;s strange condition of
      mind, which became more evident each moment, and which none could avoid
      noticing.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took her glass, and vowed she would empty it three times that evening.
      She was hysterical, and laughed aloud every other minute with no apparent
      reason&mdash;the next moment relapsing into gloom and thoughtfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of her guests suspected that she must be ill; but concluded at last
      that she was expecting something, for she continued to look at her watch
      impatiently and unceasingly; she was most absent and strange.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to be a little feverish tonight,&rdquo; said the actress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I feel quite ill. I have been obliged to put on this shawl&mdash;I
      feel so cold,&rdquo; replied Nastasia. She certainly had grown very pale, and
      every now and then she tried to suppress a trembling in her limbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had we not better allow our hostess to retire?&rdquo; asked Totski of the
      general.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all, gentlemen, not at all! Your presence is absolutely necessary
      to me tonight,&rdquo; said Nastasia, significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      As most of those present were aware that this evening a certain very
      important decision was to be taken, these words of Nastasia Philipovna&rsquo;s
      appeared to be fraught with much hidden interest. The general and Totski
      exchanged looks; Gania fidgeted convulsively in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s play at some game!&rdquo; suggested the actress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know a new and most delightful game, added Ferdishenko.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked the actress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, when we tried it we were a party of people, like this, for
      instance; and somebody proposed that each of us, without leaving his place
      at the table, should relate something about himself. It had to be
      something that he really and honestly considered the very worst action he
      had ever committed in his life. But he was to be honest&mdash;that was the
      chief point! He wasn&rsquo;t to be allowed to lie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an extraordinary idea!&rdquo; said the general.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the beauty of it, general!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a funny notion,&rdquo; said Totski, &ldquo;and yet quite natural&mdash;it&rsquo;s only
      a new way of boasting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps that is just what was so fascinating about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it would be a game to cry over&mdash;not to laugh at!&rdquo; said the
      actress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did it succeed?&rdquo; asked Nastasia Philipovna. &ldquo;Come, let&rsquo;s try it, let&rsquo;s
      try it; we really are not quite so jolly as we might be&mdash;let&rsquo;s try
      it! We may like it; it&rsquo;s original, at all events!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ferdishenko; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a good idea&mdash;come along&mdash;the men
      begin. Of course no one need tell a story if he prefers to be disobliging.
      We must draw lots! Throw your slips of paper, gentlemen, into this hat,
      and the prince shall draw for turns. It&rsquo;s a very simple game; all you have
      to do is to tell the story of the worst action of your life. It&rsquo;s as
      simple as anything. I&rsquo;ll prompt anyone who forgets the rules!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No one liked the idea much. Some smiled, some frowned; some objected, but
      faintly, not wishing to oppose Nastasia&rsquo;s wishes; for this new idea seemed
      to be rather well received by her. She was still in an excited, hysterical
      state, laughing convulsively at nothing and everything. Her eyes were
      blazing, and her cheeks showed two bright red spots against the white. The
      melancholy appearance of some of her guests seemed to add to her sarcastic
      humour, and perhaps the very cynicism and cruelty of the game proposed by
      Ferdishenko pleased her. At all events she was attracted by the idea, and
      gradually her guests came round to her side; the thing was original, at
      least, and might turn out to be amusing. &ldquo;And supposing it&rsquo;s something
      that one&mdash;one can&rsquo;t speak about before ladies?&rdquo; asked the timid and
      silent young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then of course, you won&rsquo;t say anything about it. As if there are not
      plenty of sins to your score without the need of those!&rdquo; said Ferdishenko.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I really don&rsquo;t know which of my actions is the worst,&rdquo; said the
      lively actress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ladies are exempted if they like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how are you to know that one isn&rsquo;t lying? And if one lies the whole
      point of the game is lost,&rdquo; said Gania.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but think how delightful to hear how one&rsquo;s friends lie! Besides you
      needn&rsquo;t be afraid, Gania; everybody knows what your worst action is
      without the need of any lying on your part. Only think, gentlemen,&rdquo;&mdash;and
      Ferdishenko here grew quite enthusiastic, &ldquo;only think with what eyes we
      shall observe one another tomorrow, after our tales have been told!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But surely this is a joke, Nastasia Philipovna?&rdquo; asked Totski. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
      really mean us to play this game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whoever is afraid of wolves had better not go into the wood,&rdquo; said
      Nastasia, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, pardon me, Mr. Ferdishenko, is it possible to make a game out of
      this kind of thing?&rdquo; persisted Totski, growing more and more uneasy. &ldquo;I
      assure you it can&rsquo;t be a success.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why not? Why, the last time I simply told straight off about how I
      stole three roubles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps so; but it is hardly possible that you told it so that it seemed
      like truth, or so that you were believed. And, as Gavrila Ardalionovitch
      has said, the least suggestion of a falsehood takes all point out of the
      game. It seems to me that sincerity, on the other hand, is only possible
      if combined with a kind of bad taste that would be utterly out of place
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How subtle you are, Afanasy Ivanovitch! You astonish me,&rdquo; cried
      Ferdishenko. &ldquo;You will remark, gentlemen, that in saying that I could not
      recount the story of my theft so as to be believed, Afanasy Ivanovitch has
      very ingeniously implied that I am not capable of thieving&mdash;(it would
      have been bad taste to say so openly); and all the time he is probably
      firmly convinced, in his own mind, that I am very well capable of it! But
      now, gentlemen, to business! Put in your slips, ladies and gentlemen&mdash;is
      yours in, Mr. Totski? So&mdash;then we are all ready; now prince, draw,
      please.&rdquo; The prince silently put his hand into the hat, and drew the
      names. Ferdishenko was first, then Ptitsin, then the general, Totski next,
      his own fifth, then Gania, and so on; the ladies did not draw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear! oh, dear!&rdquo; cried Ferdishenko. &ldquo;I did so hope the prince would
      come out first, and then the general. Well, gentlemen, I suppose I must
      set a good example! What vexes me much is that I am such an insignificant
      creature that it matters nothing to anybody whether I have done bad
      actions or not! Besides, which am I to choose? It&rsquo;s an <i>embarras de
      richesse</i>. Shall I tell how I became a thief on one occasion only, to
      convince Afanasy Ivanovitch that it is possible to steal without being a
      thief?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do go on, Ferdishenko, and don&rsquo;t make unnecessary preface, or you&rsquo;ll
      never finish,&rdquo; said Nastasia Philipovna. All observed how irritable and
      cross she had become since her last burst of laughter; but none the less
      obstinately did she stick to her absurd whim about this new game. Totski
      sat looking miserable enough. The general lingered over his champagne, and
      seemed to be thinking of some story for the time when his turn should
      come.
    </p>
    <h3>
      XIV.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no wit, Nastasia Philipovna,&rdquo; began Ferdishenko, &ldquo;and therefore I
      talk too much, perhaps. Were I as witty, now, as Mr. Totski or the
      general, I should probably have sat silent all the evening, as they have.
      Now, prince, what do you think?&mdash;are there not far more thieves than
      honest men in this world? Don&rsquo;t you think we may say there does not exist
      a single person so honest that he has never stolen anything whatever in
      his life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a silly idea,&rdquo; said the actress. &ldquo;Of course it is not the case. I
      have never stolen anything, for one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m! very well, Daria Alexeyevna; you have not stolen anything&mdash;agreed.
      But how about the prince, now&mdash;look how he is blushing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you are partially right, but you exaggerate,&rdquo; said the prince,
      who had certainly blushed up, of a sudden, for some reason or other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ferdishenko&mdash;either tell us your story, or be quiet, and mind your
      own business. You exhaust all patience,&rdquo; cuttingly and irritably remarked
      Nastasia Philipovna.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Immediately, immediately! As for my story, gentlemen, it is too stupid
      and absurd to tell you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you I am not a thief, and yet I have stolen; I cannot explain
      why. It was at Semeon Ivanovitch Ishenka&rsquo;s country house, one Sunday. He
      had a dinner party. After dinner the men stayed at the table over their
      wine. It struck me to ask the daughter of the house to play something on
      the piano; so I passed through the corner room to join the ladies. In that
      room, on Maria Ivanovna&rsquo;s writing-table, I observed a three-rouble note.
      She must have taken it out for some purpose, and left it lying there.
      There was no one about. I took up the note and put it in my pocket; why, I
      can&rsquo;t say. I don&rsquo;t know what possessed me to do it, but it was done, and I
      went quickly back to the dining-room and reseated myself at the
      dinner-table. I sat and waited there in a great state of excitement. I
      talked hard, and told lots of stories, and laughed like mad; then I joined
      the ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In half an hour or so the loss was discovered, and the servants were
      being put under examination. Daria, the housemaid was suspected. I
      exhibited the greatest interest and sympathy, and I remember that poor
      Daria quite lost her head, and that I began assuring her, before everyone,
      that I would guarantee her forgiveness on the part of her mistress, if she
      would confess her guilt. They all stared at the girl, and I remember a
      wonderful attraction in the reflection that here was I sermonizing away,
      with the money in my own pocket all the while. I went and spent the three
      roubles that very evening at a restaurant. I went in and asked for a
      bottle of Lafite, and drank it up; I wanted to be rid of the money.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not feel much remorse either then or afterwards; but I would not
      repeat the performance&mdash;believe it or not as you please. There&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only, of course that&rsquo;s not nearly your worst action,&rdquo; said the actress,
      with evident dislike in her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was a psychological phenomenon, not an action,&rdquo; remarked Totski.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what about the maid?&rdquo; asked Nastasia Philipovna, with undisguised
      contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, she was turned out next day, of course. It&rsquo;s a very strict household,
      there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you allowed it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think so, rather! I was not going to return and confess next
      day,&rdquo; laughed Ferdishenko, who seemed a little surprised at the
      disagreeable impression which his story had made on all parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How mean you were!&rdquo; said Nastasia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah! you wish to hear a man tell of his worst actions, and you expect the
      story to come out goody-goody! One&rsquo;s worst actions always are mean. We
      shall see what the general has to say for himself now. All is not gold
      that glitters, you know; and because a man keeps his carriage he need not
      be specially virtuous, I assure you, all sorts of people keep carriages.
      And by what means?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a word, Ferdishenko was very angry and rapidly forgetting himself; his
      whole face was drawn with passion. Strange as it may appear, he had
      expected much better success for his story. These little errors of taste
      on Ferdishenko&rsquo;s part occurred very frequently. Nastasia trembled with
      rage, and looked fixedly at him, whereupon he relapsed into alarmed
      silence. He realized that he had gone a little too far.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had we not better end this game?&rdquo; asked Totski.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my turn, but I plead exemption,&rdquo; said Ptitsin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t care to oblige us?&rdquo; asked Nastasia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot, I assure you. I confess I do not understand how anyone can play
      this game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, general, it&rsquo;s your turn,&rdquo; continued Nastasia Philipovna, &ldquo;and if
      you refuse, the whole game will fall through, which will disappoint me
      very much, for I was looking forward to relating a certain &lsquo;page of my own
      life.&rsquo; I am only waiting for you and Afanasy Ivanovitch to have your
      turns, for I require the support of your example,&rdquo; she added, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, if you put it in that way,&rdquo; cried the general, excitedly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready
      to tell the whole story of my life, but I must confess that I prepared a
      little story in anticipation of my turn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nastasia smiled amiably at him; but evidently her depression and
      irritability were increasing with every moment. Totski was dreadfully
      alarmed to hear her promise a revelation out of her own life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, like everyone else,&rdquo; began the general, &ldquo;have committed certain not
      altogether graceful actions, so to speak, during the course of my life.
      But the strangest thing of all in my case is, that I should consider the
      little anecdote which I am now about to give you as a confession of the
      worst of my &lsquo;bad actions.&rsquo; It is thirty-five years since it all happened,
      and yet I cannot to this very day recall the circumstances without, as it
      were, a sudden pang at the heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a silly affair&mdash;I was an ensign at the time. You know ensigns&mdash;their
      blood is boiling water, their circumstances generally penurious. Well, I
      had a servant Nikifor who used to do everything for me in my quarters,
      economized and managed for me, and even laid hands on anything he could
      find (belonging to other people), in order to augment our household goods;
      but a faithful, honest fellow all the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was strict, but just by nature. At that time we were stationed in a
      small town. I was quartered at an old widow&rsquo;s house, a lieutenant&rsquo;s widow
      of eighty years of age. She lived in a wretched little wooden house, and
      had not even a servant, so poor was she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her relations had all died off&mdash;her husband was dead and buried
      forty years since; and a niece, who had lived with her and bullied her up
      to three years ago, was dead too; so that she was quite alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I was precious dull with her, especially as she was so childish
      that there was nothing to be got out of her. Eventually, she stole a fowl
      of mine; the business is a mystery to this day; but it could have been no
      one but herself. I requested to be quartered somewhere else, and was
      shifted to the other end of the town, to the house of a merchant with a
      large family, and a long beard, as I remember him. Nikifor and I were
      delighted to go; but the old lady was not pleased at our departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, a day or two afterwards, when I returned from drill, Nikifor says
      to me: &lsquo;We oughtn&rsquo;t to have left our tureen with the old lady, I&rsquo;ve
      nothing to serve the soup in.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I asked how it came about that the tureen had been left. Nikifor
      explained that the old lady refused to give it up, because, she said, we
      had broken her bowl, and she must have our tureen in place of it; she had
      declared that I had so arranged the matter with herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This baseness on her part of course aroused my young blood to fever heat;
      I jumped up, and away I flew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I arrived at the old woman&rsquo;s house beside myself. She was sitting in a
      corner all alone, leaning her face on her hand. I fell on her like a clap
      of thunder. &lsquo;You old wretch!&rsquo; I yelled and all that sort of thing, in real
      Russian style. Well, when I began cursing at her, a strange thing
      happened. I looked at her, and she stared back with her eyes starting out
      of her head, but she did not say a word. She seemed to sway about as she
      sat, and looked and looked at me in the strangest way. Well, I soon
      stopped swearing and looked closer at her, asked her questions, but not a
      word could I get out of her. The flies were buzzing about the room and
      only this sound broke the silence; the sun was setting outside; I didn&rsquo;t
      know what to make of it, so I went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before I reached home I was met and summoned to the major&rsquo;s, so that it
      was some while before I actually got there. When I came in, Nikifor met
      me. &lsquo;Have you heard, sir, that our old lady is dead?&rsquo; &lsquo;<i>dead</i>, when?&rsquo;
      &lsquo;Oh, an hour and a half ago.&rsquo; That meant nothing more nor less than that
      she was dying at the moment when I pounced on her and began abusing her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This produced a great effect upon me. I used to dream of the poor old
      woman at nights. I really am not superstitious, but two days after, I went
      to her funeral, and as time went on I thought more and more about her. I
      said to myself, &lsquo;This woman, this human being, lived to a great age. She
      had children, a husband and family, friends and relations; her household
      was busy and cheerful; she was surrounded by smiling faces; and then
      suddenly they are gone, and she is left alone like a solitary fly... like
      a fly, cursed with the burden of her age. At last, God calls her to
      Himself. At sunset, on a lovely summer&rsquo;s evening, my little old woman
      passes away&mdash;a thought, you will notice, which offers much food for
      reflection&mdash;and behold! instead of tears and prayers to start her on
      her last journey, she has insults and jeers from a young ensign, who
      stands before her with his hands in his pockets, making a terrible row
      about a soup tureen!&rsquo; Of course I was to blame, and even now that I have
      time to look back at it calmly, I pity the poor old thing no less. I
      repeat that I wonder at myself, for after all I was not really
      responsible. Why did she take it into her head to die at that moment? But
      the more I thought of it, the more I felt the weight of it upon my mind;
      and I never got quite rid of the impression until I put a couple of old
      women into an almshouse and kept them there at my own expense. There,
      that&rsquo;s all. I repeat I dare say I have committed many a grievous sin in my
      day; but I cannot help always looking back upon this as the worst action I
      have ever perpetrated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m! and instead of a bad action, your excellency has detailed one of
      your noblest deeds,&rdquo; said Ferdishenko. &ldquo;Ferdishenko is &lsquo;done.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me, general,&rdquo; said Nastasia Philipovna, absently, &ldquo;I really never
      imagined you had such a good heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The general laughed with great satisfaction, and applied himself once more
      to the champagne.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now Totski&rsquo;s turn, and his story was awaited with great curiosity&mdash;while
      all eyes turned on Nastasia Philipovna, as though anticipating that his
      revelation must be connected somehow with her. Nastasia, during the whole
      of his story, pulled at the lace trimming of her sleeve, and never once
      glanced at the speaker. Totski was a handsome man, rather stout, with a
      very polite and dignified manner. He was always well dressed, and his
      linen was exquisite. He had plump white hands, and wore a magnificent
      diamond ring on one finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What simplifies the duty before me considerably, in my opinion,&rdquo; he
      began, &ldquo;is that I am bound to recall and relate the very worst action of
      my life. In such circumstances there can, of course, be no doubt. One&rsquo;s
      conscience very soon informs one what is the proper narrative to tell. I
      admit, that among the many silly and thoughtless actions of my life, the
      memory of one comes prominently forward and reminds me that it lay long
      like a stone on my heart. Some twenty years since, I paid a visit to
      Platon Ordintzeff at his country-house. He had just been elected marshal
      of the nobility, and had come there with his young wife for the winter
      holidays. Anfisa Alexeyevna&rsquo;s birthday came off just then, too, and there
      were two balls arranged. At that time Dumas-fils&rsquo; beautiful work, <i>La
      Dame aux Camélias</i>&mdash;a novel which I consider imperishable&mdash;had
      just come into fashion. In the provinces all the ladies were in raptures
      over it, those who had read it, at least. Camellias were all the fashion.
      Everyone inquired for them, everybody wanted them; and a grand lot of
      camellias are to be got in a country town&mdash;as you all know&mdash;and
      two balls to provide for!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Peter Volhofskoi was desperately in love with Anfisa Alexeyevna. I
      don&rsquo;t know whether there was anything&mdash;I mean I don&rsquo;t know whether he
      could possibly have indulged in any hope. The poor fellow was beside
      himself to get her a bouquet of camellias. Countess Sotski and Sophia
      Bespalova, as everyone knew, were coming with white camellia bouquets.
      Anfisa wished for red ones, for effect. Well, her husband Platon was
      driven desperate to find some. And the day before the ball, Anfisa&rsquo;s rival
      snapped up the only red camellias to be had in the place, from under
      Platon&rsquo;s nose, and Platon&mdash;wretched man&mdash;was done for. Now if
      Peter had only been able to step in at this moment with a red bouquet, his
      little hopes might have made gigantic strides. A woman&rsquo;s gratitude under
      such circumstances would have been boundless&mdash;but it was practically
      an impossibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The night before the ball I met Peter, looking radiant. &lsquo;What is it?&rsquo; I
      ask. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve found them, Eureka!&rsquo; &lsquo;No! where, where?&rsquo; &lsquo;At Ekshaisk (a little
      town fifteen miles off) there&rsquo;s a rich old merchant, who keeps a lot of
      canaries, has no children, and he and his wife are devoted to flowers.
      He&rsquo;s got some camellias.&rsquo; &lsquo;And what if he won&rsquo;t let you have them?&rsquo; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll
      go on my knees and implore till I get them. I won&rsquo;t go away.&rsquo; &lsquo;When shall
      you start?&rsquo; &lsquo;Tomorrow morning at five o&rsquo;clock.&rsquo; &lsquo;Go on,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;and good
      luck to you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was glad for the poor fellow, and went home. But an idea got hold of me
      somehow. I don&rsquo;t know how. It was nearly two in the morning. I rang the
      bell and ordered the coachman to be waked up and sent to me. He came. I
      gave him a tip of fifteen roubles, and told him to get the carriage ready
      at once. In half an hour it was at the door. I got in and off we went.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By five I drew up at the Ekshaisky inn. I waited there till dawn, and
      soon after six I was off, and at the old merchant Trepalaf&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Camellias!&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;father, save me, save me, let me have some
      camellias!&rsquo; He was a tall, grey old man&mdash;a terrible-looking old
      gentleman. &lsquo;Not a bit of it,&rsquo; he says. &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t.&rsquo; Down I went on my knees.
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t say so, don&rsquo;t&mdash;think what you&rsquo;re doing!&rsquo; I cried; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s a
      matter of life and death!&rsquo; &lsquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, take them,&rsquo; says he. So up
      I get, and cut such a bouquet of red camellias! He had a whole greenhouse
      full of them&mdash;lovely ones. The old fellow sighs. I pull out a hundred
      roubles. &lsquo;No, no!&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t insult me that way.&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh, if that&rsquo;s the
      case, give it to the village hospital,&rsquo; I say. &lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s
      quite a different matter; that&rsquo;s good of you and generous. I&rsquo;ll pay it in
      there for you with pleasure.&rsquo; I liked that old fellow, Russian to the
      core, <i>de la vraie souche</i>. I went home in raptures, but took another
      road in order to avoid Peter. Immediately on arriving I sent up the
      bouquet for Anfisa to see when she awoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may imagine her ecstasy, her gratitude. The wretched Platon, who had
      almost died since yesterday of the reproaches showered upon him, wept on
      my shoulder. Of course poor Peter had no chance after this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought he would cut my throat at first, and went about armed ready to
      meet him. But he took it differently; he fainted, and had brain fever and
      convulsions. A month after, when he had hardly recovered, he went off to
      the Crimea, and there he was shot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you this business left me no peace for many a long year. Why did
      I do it? I was not in love with her myself; I&rsquo;m afraid it was simply
      mischief&mdash;pure &lsquo;cussedness&rsquo; on my part.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I hadn&rsquo;t seized that bouquet from under his nose he might have been
      alive now, and a happy man. He might have been successful in life, and
      never have gone to fight the Turks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Totski ended his tale with the same dignity that had characterized its
      commencement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nastasia Philipovna&rsquo;s eyes were flashing in a most unmistakable way, now;
      and her lips were all a-quiver by the time Totski finished his story.
    </p>
    <p>
      All present watched both of them with curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were right, Totski,&rdquo; said Nastasia, &ldquo;it is a dull game and a stupid
      one. I&rsquo;ll just tell my story, as I promised, and then we&rsquo;ll play cards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but let&rsquo;s have the story first!&rdquo; cried the general.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prince,&rdquo; said Nastasia Philipovna, unexpectedly turning to Muishkin,
      &ldquo;here are my old friends, Totski and General Epanchin, who wish to marry
      me off. Tell me what you think. Shall I marry or not? As you decide, so
      shall it be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Totski grew white as a sheet. The general was struck dumb. All present
      started and listened intently. Gania sat rooted to his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marry whom?&rdquo; asked the prince, faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gavrila Ardalionovitch Ivolgin,&rdquo; said Nastasia, firmly and evenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were a few seconds of dead silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince tried to speak, but could not form his words; a great weight
      seemed to lie upon his breast and suffocate him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N-no! don&rsquo;t marry him!&rdquo; he whispered at last, drawing his breath with an
      effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So be it, then. Gavrila Ardalionovitch,&rdquo; she spoke solemnly and forcibly,
      &ldquo;you hear the prince&rsquo;s decision? Take it as my decision; and let that be
      the end of the matter for good and all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nastasia Philipovna!&rdquo; cried Totski, in a quaking voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nastasia Philipovna!&rdquo; said the general, in persuasive but agitated tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone in the room fidgeted in their places, and waited to see what was
      coming next.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, gentlemen!&rdquo; she continued, gazing around in apparent astonishment;
      &ldquo;what do you all look so alarmed about? Why are you so upset?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;recollect, Nastasia Philipovna,&rdquo; stammered Totski, &ldquo;you gave a
      promise, quite a free one, and&mdash;and you might have spared us this. I
      am confused and bewildered, I know; but, in a word, at such a moment, and
      before company, and all so-so-irregular, finishing off a game with a
      serious matter like this, a matter of honour, and of heart, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t follow you, Afanasy Ivanovitch; you are losing your head. In the
      first place, what do you mean by &lsquo;before company&rsquo;? Isn&rsquo;t the company good
      enough for you? And what&rsquo;s all that about &lsquo;a game&rsquo;? I wished to tell my
      little story, and I told it! Don&rsquo;t you like it? You heard what I said to
      the prince? &lsquo;As you decide, so it shall be!&rsquo; If he had said &lsquo;yes,&rsquo; I
      should have given my consent! But he said &lsquo;no,&rsquo; so I refused. Here was my
      whole life hanging on his one word! Surely I was serious enough?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The prince! What on earth has the prince got to do with it? Who the deuce
      is the prince?&rdquo; cried the general, who could conceal his wrath no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The prince has this to do with it&mdash;that I see in him for the first
      time in all my life, a man endowed with real truthfulness of spirit, and I
      trust him. He trusted me at first sight, and I trust him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It only remains for me, then, to thank Nastasia Philipovna for the great
      delicacy with which she has treated me,&rdquo; said Gania, as pale as death, and
      with quivering lips. &ldquo;That is my plain duty, of course; but the prince&mdash;what
      has he to do in the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see what you are driving at,&rdquo; said Nastasia Philipovna. &ldquo;You imply that
      the prince is after the seventy-five thousand roubles&mdash;I quite
      understand you. Mr. Totski, I forgot to say, &lsquo;Take your seventy-five
      thousand roubles&rsquo;&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want them. I let you go free for nothing&mdash;take
      your freedom! You must need it. Nine years and three months&rsquo; captivity is
      enough for anybody. Tomorrow I shall start afresh&mdash;today I am a free
      agent for the first time in my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;General, you must take your pearls back, too&mdash;give them to your wife&mdash;here
      they are! Tomorrow I shall leave this flat altogether, and then there&rsquo;ll
      be no more of these pleasant little social gatherings, ladies and
      gentlemen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, she scornfully rose from her seat as though to depart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nastasia Philipovna! Nastasia Philipovna!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words burst involuntarily from every mouth. All present started up in
      bewildered excitement; all surrounded her; all had listened uneasily to
      her wild, disconnected sentences. All felt that something had happened,
      something had gone very far wrong indeed, but no one could make head or
      tail of the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment there was a furious ring at the bell, and a great knock at
      the door&mdash;exactly similar to the one which had startled the company
      at Gania&rsquo;s house in the afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, ah! here&rsquo;s the climax at last, at half-past twelve!&rdquo; cried Nastasia
      Philipovna. &ldquo;Sit down, gentlemen, I beg you. Something is about to
      happen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, she reseated herself; a strange smile played on her lips. She
      sat quite still, but watched the door in a fever of impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rogojin and his hundred thousand roubles, no doubt of it,&rdquo; muttered
      Ptitsin to himself.
    </p>
    <h3>
      XV.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Katia, the maid-servant, made her appearance, terribly frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodness knows what it means, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There is a whole
      collection of men come&mdash;all tipsy&mdash;and want to see you. They say
      that &lsquo;it&rsquo;s Rogojin, and she knows all about it.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Katia, let them all in at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely not <i>all</i>, ma&rsquo;am? They seem so disorderly&mdash;it&rsquo;s dreadful
      to see them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes <i>all</i>, Katia, all&mdash;every one of them. Let them in, or
      they&rsquo;ll come in whether you like or no. Listen! what a noise they are
      making! Perhaps you are offended, gentlemen, that I should receive such
      guests in your presence? I am very sorry, and ask your forgiveness, but it
      cannot be helped&mdash;and I should be very grateful if you could all stay
      and witness this climax. However, just as you please, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The guests exchanged glances; they were annoyed and bewildered by the
      episode; but it was clear enough that all this had been pre-arranged and
      expected by Nastasia Philipovna, and that there was no use in trying to
      stop her now&mdash;for she was little short of insane.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, they were naturally inquisitive to see what was to happen. There
      was nobody who would be likely to feel much alarm. There were but two
      ladies present; one of whom was the lively actress, who was not easily
      frightened, and the other the silent German beauty who, it turned out, did
      not understand a word of Russian, and seemed to be as stupid as she was
      lovely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her acquaintances invited her to their &ldquo;At Homes&rdquo; because she was so
      decorative. She was exhibited to their guests like a valuable picture, or
      vase, or statue, or firescreen. As for the men, Ptitsin was one of
      Rogojin&rsquo;s friends; Ferdishenko was as much at home as a fish in the sea,
      Gania, not yet recovered from his amazement, appeared to be chained to a
      pillory. The old professor did not in the least understand what was
      happening; but when he noticed how extremely agitated the mistress of the
      house, and her friends, seemed, he nearly wept, and trembled with fright:
      but he would rather have died than leave Nastasia Philipovna at such a
      crisis, for he loved her as if she were his own granddaughter. Afanasy
      Ivanovitch greatly disliked having anything to do with the affair, but he
      was too much interested to leave, in spite of the mad turn things had
      taken; and a few words that had dropped from the lips of Nastasia puzzled
      him so much, that he felt he could not go without an explanation. He
      resolved therefore, to see it out, and to adopt the attitude of silent
      spectator, as most suited to his dignity. General Epanchin alone
      determined to depart. He was annoyed at the manner in which his gift had
      been returned, as though he had condescended, under the influence of
      passion, to place himself on a level with Ptitsin and Ferdishenko, his
      self-respect and sense of duty now returned together with a consciousness
      of what was due to his social rank and official importance. In short, he
      plainly showed his conviction that a man in his position could have
      nothing to do with Rogojin and his companions. But Nastasia interrupted
      him at his first words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, general!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I was forgetting! If I had only foreseen this
      unpleasantness! I won&rsquo;t insist on keeping you against your will, although
      I should have liked you to be beside me now. In any case, I am most
      grateful to you for your visit, and flattering attention... but if you are
      afraid...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, Nastasia Philipovna,&rdquo; interrupted the general, with chivalric
      generosity. &ldquo;To whom are you speaking? I have remained until now simply
      because of my devotion to you, and as for danger, I am only afraid that
      the carpets may be ruined, and the furniture smashed!... You should shut
      the door on the lot, in my opinion. But I confess that I am extremely
      curious to see how it ends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rogojin!&rdquo; announced Ferdishenko.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think about it?&rdquo; said the general in a low voice to Totski.
      &ldquo;Is she mad? I mean mad in the medical sense of the word .... eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always said she was predisposed to it,&rdquo; whispered Afanasy Ivanovitch
      slyly. &ldquo;Perhaps it is a fever!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Since their visit to Gania&rsquo;s home, Rogojin&rsquo;s followers had been increased
      by two new recruits&mdash;a dissolute old man, the hero of some ancient
      scandal, and a retired sub-lieutenant. A laughable story was told of the
      former. He possessed, it was said, a set of false teeth, and one day when
      he wanted money for a drinking orgy, he pawned them, and was never able to
      reclaim them! The officer appeared to be a rival of the gentleman who was
      so proud of his fists. He was known to none of Rogojin&rsquo;s followers, but as
      they passed by the Nevsky, where he stood begging, he had joined their
      ranks. His claim for the charity he desired seemed based on the fact that
      in the days of his prosperity he had given away as much as fifteen roubles
      at a time. The rivals seemed more than a little jealous of one another.
      The athlete appeared injured at the admission of the &ldquo;beggar&rdquo; into the
      company. By nature taciturn, he now merely growled occasionally like a
      bear, and glared contemptuously upon the &ldquo;beggar,&rdquo; who, being somewhat of
      a man of the world, and a diplomatist, tried to insinuate himself into the
      bear&rsquo;s good graces. He was a much smaller man than the athlete, and
      doubtless was conscious that he must tread warily. Gently and without
      argument he alluded to the advantages of the English style in boxing, and
      showed himself a firm believer in Western institutions. The athlete&rsquo;s lips
      curled disdainfully, and without honouring his adversary with a formal
      denial, he exhibited, as if by accident, that peculiarly Russian object&mdash;an
      enormous fist, clenched, muscular, and covered with red hairs! The sight
      of this pre-eminently national attribute was enough to convince anybody,
      without words, that it was a serious matter for those who should happen to
      come into contact with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      None of the band were very drunk, for the leader had kept his intended
      visit to Nastasia in view all day, and had done his best to prevent his
      followers from drinking too much. He was sober himself, but the excitement
      of this chaotic day&mdash;the strangest day of his life&mdash;had affected
      him so that he was in a dazed, wild condition, which almost resembled
      drunkenness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had kept but one idea before him all day, and for that he had worked in
      an agony of anxiety and a fever of suspense. His lieutenants had worked so
      hard from five o&rsquo;clock until eleven, that they actually had collected a
      hundred thousand roubles for him, but at such terrific expense, that the
      rate of interest was only mentioned among them in whispers and with bated
      breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      As before, Rogojin walked in advance of his troop, who followed him with
      mingled self-assertion and timidity. They were specially frightened of
      Nastasia Philipovna herself, for some reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many of them expected to be thrown downstairs at once, without further
      ceremony, the elegant and irresistible Zaleshoff among them. But the party
      led by the athlete, without openly showing their hostile intentions,
      silently nursed contempt and even hatred for Nastasia Philipovna, and
      marched into her house as they would have marched into an enemy&rsquo;s
      fortress. Arrived there, the luxury of the rooms seemed to inspire them
      with a kind of respect, not unmixed with alarm. So many things were
      entirely new to their experience&mdash;the choice furniture, the pictures,
      the great statue of Venus. They followed their chief into the salon,
      however, with a kind of impudent curiosity. There, the sight of General
      Epanchin among the guests, caused many of them to beat a hasty retreat
      into the adjoining room, the &ldquo;boxer&rdquo; and &ldquo;beggar&rdquo; being among the first to
      go. A few only, of whom Lebedeff made one, stood their ground; he had
      contrived to walk side by side with Rogojin, for he quite understood the
      importance of a man who had a fortune of a million odd roubles, and who at
      this moment carried a hundred thousand in his hand. It may be added that
      the whole company, not excepting Lebedeff, had the vaguest idea of the
      extent of their powers, and of how far they could safely go. At some
      moments Lebedeff was sure that right was on their side; at others he tried
      uneasily to remember various cheering and reassuring articles of the Civil
      Code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rogojin, when he stepped into the room, and his eyes fell upon Nastasia,
      stopped short, grew white as a sheet, and stood staring; it was clear that
      his heart was beating painfully. So he stood, gazing intently, but
      timidly, for a few seconds. Suddenly, as though bereft of his senses, he
      moved forward, staggering helplessly, towards the table. On his way he
      collided against Ptitsin&rsquo;s chair, and put his dirty foot on the lace skirt
      of the silent lady&rsquo;s dress; but he neither apologized for this, nor even
      noticed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      On reaching the table, he placed upon it a strange-looking object, which
      he had carried with him into the drawing-room. This was a paper packet,
      some six or seven inches thick, and eight or nine in length, wrapped in an
      old newspaper, and tied round three or four times with string.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having placed this before her, he stood with drooped arms and head, as
      though awaiting his sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      His costume was the same as it had been in the morning, except for a new
      silk handkerchief round his neck, bright green and red, fastened with a
      huge diamond pin, and an enormous diamond ring on his dirty forefinger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lebedeff stood two or three paces behind his chief; and the rest of the
      band waited about near the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two maid-servants were both peeping in, frightened and amazed at this
      unusual and disorderly scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; asked Nastasia Philipovna, gazing intently at Rogojin, and
      indicating the paper packet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hundred thousand,&rdquo; replied the latter, almost in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! so he kept his word&mdash;there&rsquo;s a man for you! Well, sit down,
      please&mdash;take that chair. I shall have something to say to you
      presently. Who are all these with you? The same party? Let them come in
      and sit down. There&rsquo;s room on that sofa, there are some chairs and there&rsquo;s
      another sofa! Well, why don&rsquo;t they sit down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sure enough, some of the brave fellows entirely lost their heads at this
      point, and retreated into the next room. Others, however, took the hint
      and sat down, as far as they could from the table, however; feeling braver
      in proportion to their distance from Nastasia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rogojin took the chair offered him, but he did not sit long; he soon stood
      up again, and did not reseat himself. Little by little he began to look
      around him and discern the other guests. Seeing Gania, he smiled
      venomously and muttered to himself, &ldquo;Look at that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gazed at Totski and the general with no apparent confusion, and with
      very little curiosity. But when he observed that the prince was seated
      beside Nastasia Philipovna, he could not take his eyes off him for a long
      while, and was clearly amazed. He could not account for the prince&rsquo;s
      presence there. It was not in the least surprising that Rogojin should be,
      at this time, in a more or less delirious condition; for not to speak of
      the excitements of the day, he had spent the night before in the train,
      and had not slept more than a wink for forty-eight hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This, gentlemen, is a hundred thousand roubles,&rdquo; said Nastasia
      Philipovna, addressing the company in general, &ldquo;here, in this dirty
      parcel. This afternoon Rogojin yelled, like a madman, that he would bring
      me a hundred thousand in the evening, and I have been waiting for him all
      the while. He was bargaining for me, you know; first he offered me
      eighteen thousand; then he rose to forty, and then to a hundred thousand.
      And he has kept his word, see! My goodness, how white he is! All this
      happened this afternoon, at Gania&rsquo;s. I had gone to pay his mother a visit&mdash;my
      future family, you know! And his sister said to my very face, surely
      somebody will turn this shameless creature out. After which she spat in
      her brother Gania&rsquo;s face&mdash;a girl of character, that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nastasia Philipovna!&rdquo; began the general, reproachfully. He was beginning
      to put his own interpretation on the affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what, general? Not quite good form, eh? Oh, nonsense! Here have I
      been sitting in my box at the French theatre for the last five years like
      a statue of inaccessible virtue, and kept out of the way of all admirers,
      like a silly little idiot! Now, there&rsquo;s this man, who comes and pays down
      his hundred thousand on the table, before you all, in spite of my five
      years of innocence and proud virtue, and I dare be sworn he has his sledge
      outside waiting to carry me off. He values me at a hundred thousand! I see
      you are still angry with me, Gania! Why, surely you never really wished to
      take <i>me</i> into your family? <i>me</i>, Rogojin&rsquo;s mistress! What did
      the prince say just now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never said you were Rogojin&rsquo;s mistress&mdash;you are <i>not!</i>&rdquo; said
      the prince, in trembling accents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nastasia Philipovna, dear soul!&rdquo; cried the actress, impatiently, &ldquo;do be
      calm, dear! If it annoys you so&mdash;all this&mdash;do go away and rest!
      Of course you would never go with this wretched fellow, in spite of his
      hundred thousand roubles! Take his money and kick him out of the house;
      that&rsquo;s the way to treat him and the likes of him! Upon my word, if it were
      my business, I&rsquo;d soon clear them all out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The actress was a kind-hearted woman, and highly impressionable. She was
      very angry now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be cross, Daria Alexeyevna!&rdquo; laughed Nastasia. &ldquo;I was not angry
      when I spoke; I wasn&rsquo;t reproaching Gania. I don&rsquo;t know how it was that I
      ever could have indulged the whim of entering an honest family like his. I
      saw his mother&mdash;and kissed her hand, too. I came and stirred up all
      that fuss, Gania, this afternoon, on purpose to see how much you could
      swallow&mdash;you surprised me, my friend&mdash;you did, indeed. Surely
      you could not marry a woman who accepts pearls like those you knew the
      general was going to give me, on the very eve of her marriage? And
      Rogojin! Why, in your own house and before your own brother and sister, he
      bargained with me! Yet you could come here and expect to be betrothed to
      me before you left the house! You almost brought your sister, too. Surely
      what Rogojin said about you is not really true: that you would crawl all
      the way to the other end of the town, on hands and knees, for three
      roubles?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he would!&rdquo; said Rogojin, quietly, but with an air of absolute
      conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m! and he receives a good salary, I&rsquo;m told. Well, what should you get
      but disgrace and misery if you took a wife you hated into your family (for
      I know very well that you do hate me)? No, no! I believe now that a man
      like you would murder anyone for money&mdash;sharpen a razor and come up
      behind his best friend and cut his throat like a sheep&mdash;I&rsquo;ve read of
      such people. Everyone seems money-mad nowadays. No, no! I may be
      shameless, but you are far worse. I don&rsquo;t say a word about that other&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nastasia Philipovna, is this really you? You, once so refined and
      delicate of speech. Oh, what a tongue! What dreadful things you are
      saying,&rdquo; cried the general, wringing his hands in real grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am intoxicated, general. I am having a day out, you know&mdash;it&rsquo;s my
      birthday! I have long looked forward to this happy occasion. Daria
      Alexeyevna, you see that nosegay-man, that Monsieur aux Camelias, sitting
      there laughing at us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not laughing, Nastasia Philipovna; I am only listening with all my
      attention,&rdquo; said Totski, with dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, why have I worried him, for five years, and never let him go free?
      Is he worth it? He is only just what he ought to be&mdash;nothing
      particular. He thinks I am to blame, too. He gave me my education, kept me
      like a countess. Money&mdash;my word! What a lot of money he spent over
      me! And he tried to find me an honest husband first, and then this Gania,
      here. And what do you think? All these five years I did not live with him,
      and yet I took his money, and considered I was quite justified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say, take the hundred thousand and kick that man out. It is true, it
      is an abominable business, as you say. I might have married long ago, not
      Gania&mdash;Oh, no!&mdash;but that would have been abominable too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you believe it, I had some thoughts of marrying Totski, four years
      ago! I meant mischief, I confess&mdash;but I could have had him, I give
      you my word; he asked me himself. But I thought, no! it&rsquo;s not worthwhile
      to take such advantage of him. No! I had better go on to the streets, or
      accept Rogojin, or become a washerwoman or something&mdash;for I have
      nothing of my own, you know. I shall go away and leave everything behind,
      to the last rag&mdash;he shall have it all back. And who would take me
      without anything? Ask Gania, there, whether he would. Why, even
      Ferdishenko wouldn&rsquo;t have me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Ferdishenko would not; he is a candid fellow, Nastasia Philipovna,&rdquo;
       said that worthy. &ldquo;But the prince would. You sit here making complaints,
      but just look at the prince. I&rsquo;ve been observing him for a long while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nastasia Philipovna looked keenly round at the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that true?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite true,&rdquo; whispered the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll take me as I am, with nothing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will, Nastasia Philipovna.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a pretty business!&rdquo; cried the general. &ldquo;However, it might have
      been expected of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince continued to regard Nastasia with a sorrowful, but intent and
      piercing, gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s another alternative for me,&rdquo; said Nastasia, turning once more to
      the actress; &ldquo;and he does it out of pure kindness of heart. I know him.
      I&rsquo;ve found a benefactor. Perhaps, though, what they say about him may be
      true&mdash;that he&rsquo;s an&mdash;we know what. And what shall you live on, if
      you are really so madly in love with Rogojin&rsquo;s mistress, that you are
      ready to marry her&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I take you as a good, honest woman, Nastasia Philipovna&mdash;not as
      Rogojin&rsquo;s mistress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? I?&mdash;good and honest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you get those ideas out of novels, you know. Times are changed now,
      dear prince; the world sees things as they really are. That&rsquo;s all
      nonsense. Besides, how can you marry? You need a nurse, not a wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince rose and began to speak in a trembling, timid tone, but with
      the air of a man absolutely sure of the truth of his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing, Nastasia Philipovna. I have seen nothing. You are right
      so far; but I consider that you would be honouring me, and not I you. I am
      a nobody. You have suffered, you have passed through hell and emerged
      pure, and that is very much. Why do you shame yourself by desiring to go
      with Rogojin? You are delirious. You have returned to Mr. Totski his
      seventy-five thousand roubles, and declared that you will leave this house
      and all that is in it, which is a line of conduct that not one person here
      would imitate. Nastasia Philipovna, I love you! I would die for you. I
      shall never let any man say one word against you, Nastasia Philipovna! and
      if we are poor, I can work for both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the prince spoke these last words a titter was heard from Ferdishenko;
      Lebedeff laughed too. The general grunted with irritation; Ptitsin and
      Totski barely restrained their smiles. The rest all sat listening,
      open-mouthed with wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But perhaps we shall not be poor; we may be very rich, Nastasia
      Philipovna,&rdquo; continued the prince, in the same timid, quivering tones. &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t know for certain, and I&rsquo;m sorry to say I haven&rsquo;t had an opportunity
      of finding out all day; but I received a letter from Moscow, while I was
      in Switzerland, from a Mr. Salaskin, and he acquaints me with the fact
      that I am entitled to a very large inheritance. This letter&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince pulled a letter out of his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he raving?&rdquo; said the general. &ldquo;Are we really in a mad-house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was silence for a moment. Then Ptitsin spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you said, prince, that your letter was from Salaskin? Salaskin is
      a very eminent man, indeed, in his own world; he is a wonderfully clever
      solicitor, and if he really tells you this, I think you may be pretty sure
      that he is right. It so happens, luckily, that I know his handwriting, for
      I have lately had business with him. If you would allow me to see it, I
      should perhaps be able to tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince held out the letter silently, but with a shaking hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, what?&rdquo; said the general, much agitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this? Is he really heir to anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All present concentrated their attention upon Ptitsin, reading the
      prince&rsquo;s letter. The general curiosity had received a new fillip.
      Ferdishenko could not sit still. Rogojin fixed his eyes first on the
      prince, and then on Ptitsin, and then back again; he was extremely
      agitated. Lebedeff could not stand it. He crept up and read over Ptitsin&rsquo;s
      shoulder, with the air of a naughty boy who expects a box on the ear every
      moment for his indiscretion.
    </p>
    <h3>
      XVI.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s good business,&rdquo; said Ptitsin, at last, folding the letter and
      handing it back to the prince. &ldquo;You will receive, without the slightest
      trouble, by the last will and testament of your aunt, a very large sum of
      money indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; cried the general, starting up as if he had been shot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ptitsin explained, for the benefit of the company, that the prince&rsquo;s aunt
      had died five months since. He had never known her, but she was his
      mother&rsquo;s own sister, the daughter of a Moscow merchant, one Paparchin, who
      had died a bankrupt. But the elder brother of this same Paparchin, had
      been an eminent and very rich merchant. A year since it had so happened
      that his only two sons had both died within the same month. This sad event
      had so affected the old man that he, too, had died very shortly after. He
      was a widower, and had no relations left, excepting the prince&rsquo;s aunt, a
      poor woman living on charity, who was herself at the point of death from
      dropsy; but who had time, before she died, to set Salaskin to work to find
      her nephew, and to make her will bequeathing her newly-acquired fortune to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It appeared that neither the prince, nor the doctor with whom he lived in
      Switzerland, had thought of waiting for further communications; but the
      prince had started straight away with Salaskin&rsquo;s letter in his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One thing I may tell you, for certain,&rdquo; concluded Ptitsin, addressing the
      prince, &ldquo;that there is no question about the authenticity of this matter.
      Anything that Salaskin writes you as regards your unquestionable right to
      this inheritance, you may look upon as so much money in your pocket. I
      congratulate you, prince; you may receive a million and a half of roubles,
      perhaps more; I don&rsquo;t know. All I <i>do</i> know is that Paparchin was a
      very rich merchant indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; cried Lebedeff, in a drunken voice. &ldquo;Hurrah for the last of the
      Muishkins!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My goodness me! and I gave him twenty-five roubles this morning as though
      he were a beggar,&rdquo; blurted out the general, half senseless with amazement.
      &ldquo;Well, I congratulate you, I congratulate you!&rdquo; And the general rose from
      his seat and solemnly embraced the prince. All came forward with
      congratulations; even those of Rogojin&rsquo;s party who had retreated into the
      next room, now crept softly back to look on. For the moment even Nastasia
      Philipovna was forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      But gradually the consciousness crept back into the minds of each one
      present that the prince had just made her an offer of marriage. The
      situation had, therefore, become three times as fantastic as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Totski sat and shrugged his shoulders, bewildered. He was the only guest
      left sitting at this time; the others had thronged round the table in
      disorder, and were all talking at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was generally agreed, afterwards, in recalling that evening, that from
      this moment Nastasia Philipovna seemed entirely to lose her senses. She
      continued to sit still in her place, looking around at her guests with a
      strange, bewildered expression, as though she were trying to collect her
      thoughts, and could not. Then she suddenly turned to the prince, and
      glared at him with frowning brows; but this only lasted one moment.
      Perhaps it suddenly struck her that all this was a jest, but his face
      seemed to reassure her. She reflected, and smiled again, vaguely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I am really a princess,&rdquo; she whispered to herself, ironically, and
      glancing accidentally at Daria Alexeyevna&rsquo;s face, she burst out laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, ha, ha!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;this is an unexpected climax, after all. I
      didn&rsquo;t expect this. What are you all standing up for, gentlemen? Sit down;
      congratulate me and the prince! Ferdishenko, just step out and order some
      more champagne, will you? Katia, Pasha,&rdquo; she added suddenly, seeing the
      servants at the door, &ldquo;come here! I&rsquo;m going to be married, did you hear?
      To the prince. He has a million and a half of roubles; he is Prince
      Muishkin, and has asked me to marry him. Here, prince, come and sit by me;
      and here comes the wine. Now then, ladies and gentlemen, where are your
      congratulations?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; cried a number of voices. A rush was made for the wine by
      Rogojin&rsquo;s followers, though, even among them, there seemed some sort of
      realization that the situation had changed. Rogojin stood and looked on,
      with an incredulous smile, screwing up one side of his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prince, my dear fellow, do remember what you are about,&rdquo; said the
      general, approaching Muishkin, and pulling him by the coat sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nastasia Philipovna overheard the remark, and burst out laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, general!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You had better look out! I am the princess
      now, you know. The prince won&rsquo;t let you insult me. Afanasy Ivanovitch, why
      don&rsquo;t you congratulate me? I shall be able to sit at table with your new
      wife, now. Aha! you see what I gain by marrying a prince! A million and a
      half, and a prince, and an idiot into the bargain, they say. What better
      could I wish for? Life is only just about to commence for me in earnest.
      Rogojin, you are a little too late. Away with your paper parcel! I&rsquo;m going
      to marry the prince; I&rsquo;m richer than you are now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Rogojin understood how things were tending, at last. An inexpressibly
      painful expression came over his face. He wrung his hands; a groan made
      its way up from the depths of his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surrender her, for God&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo; he said to the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      All around burst out laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Surrender her to <i>you?</i>&rdquo; cried Daria Alexeyevna. &ldquo;To a fellow
      who comes and bargains for a wife like a moujik! The prince wishes to
      marry her, and you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do I, so do I! This moment, if I could! I&rsquo;d give every farthing I have
      to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You drunken moujik,&rdquo; said Daria Alexeyevna, once more. &ldquo;You ought to be
      kicked out of the place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The laughter became louder than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you hear, prince?&rdquo; said Nastasia Philipovna. &ldquo;Do you hear how this
      moujik of a fellow goes on bargaining for your bride?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is drunk,&rdquo; said the prince, quietly, &ldquo;and he loves you very much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you be ashamed, afterwards, to reflect that your wife very nearly
      ran away with Rogojin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you were raving, you were in a fever; you are still half delirious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And won&rsquo;t you be ashamed when they tell you, afterwards, that your wife
      lived at Totski&rsquo;s expense so many years?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I shall not be ashamed of that. You did not so live by your own
      will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll never reproach me with it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care, don&rsquo;t commit yourself for a whole lifetime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nastasia Philipovna.&rdquo; said the prince, quietly, and with deep emotion, &ldquo;I
      said before that I shall esteem your consent to be my wife as a great
      honour to myself, and shall consider that it is you who will honour me,
      not I you, by our marriage. You laughed at these words, and others around
      us laughed as well; I heard them. Very likely I expressed myself funnily,
      and I may have looked funny, but, for all that, I believe I understand
      where honour lies, and what I said was but the literal truth. You were
      about to ruin yourself just now, irrevocably; you would never have
      forgiven yourself for so doing afterwards; and yet, you are absolutely
      blameless. It is impossible that your life should be altogether ruined at
      your age. What matter that Rogojin came bargaining here, and that Gavrila
      Ardalionovitch would have deceived you if he could? Why do you continually
      remind us of these facts? I assure you once more that very few could find
      it in them to act as you have acted this day. As for your wish to go with
      Rogojin, that was simply the idea of a delirious and suffering brain. You
      are still quite feverish; you ought to be in bed, not here. You know quite
      well that if you had gone with Rogojin, you would have become a
      washer-woman next day, rather than stay with him. You are proud, Nastasia
      Philipovna, and perhaps you have really suffered so much that you imagine
      yourself to be a desperately guilty woman. You require a great deal of
      petting and looking after, Nastasia Philipovna, and I will do this. I saw
      your portrait this morning, and it seemed quite a familiar face to me; it
      seemed to me that the portrait-face was calling to me for help. I&mdash;I
      shall respect you all my life, Nastasia Philipovna,&rdquo; concluded the prince,
      as though suddenly recollecting himself, and blushing to think of the sort
      of company before whom he had said all this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ptitsin bowed his head and looked at the ground, overcome by a mixture of
      feelings. Totski muttered to himself: &ldquo;He may be an idiot, but he knows
      that flattery is the best road to success here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince observed Gania&rsquo;s eyes flashing at him, as though they would
      gladly annihilate him then and there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a kind-hearted man, if you like,&rdquo; said Daria Alexeyevna, whose
      wrath was quickly evaporating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A refined man, but&mdash;lost,&rdquo; murmured the general.
    </p>
    <p>
      Totski took his hat and rose to go. He and the general exchanged glances,
      making a private arrangement, thereby, to leave the house together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, prince; no one has ever spoken to me like that before,&rdquo; began
      Nastasia Philipovna. &ldquo;Men have always bargained for me, before this; and
      not a single respectable man has ever proposed to marry me. Do you hear,
      Afanasy Ivanovitch? What do <i>you</i> think of what the prince has just
      been saying? It was almost immodest, wasn&rsquo;t it? You, Rogojin, wait a
      moment, don&rsquo;t go yet! I see you don&rsquo;t intend to move however. Perhaps I
      may go with you yet. Where did you mean to take me to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Ekaterinhof,&rdquo; replied Lebedeff. Rogojin simply stood staring, with
      trembling lips, not daring to believe his ears. He was stunned, as though
      from a blow on the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you thinking of, my dear Nastasia?&rdquo; said Daria Alexeyevna in
      alarm. &ldquo;What are you saying?&rdquo; &ldquo;You are not going mad, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nastasia Philipovna burst out laughing and jumped up from the sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You thought I should accept this good child&rsquo;s invitation to ruin him, did
      you?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Totski&rsquo;s way, not mine. He&rsquo;s fond of children.
      Come along, Rogojin, get your money ready! We won&rsquo;t talk about marrying
      just at this moment, but let&rsquo;s see the money at all events. Come! I may
      not marry you, either. I don&rsquo;t know. I suppose you thought you&rsquo;d keep the
      money, if I did! Ha, ha, ha! nonsense! I have no sense of shame left. I
      tell you I have been Totski&rsquo;s concubine. Prince, you must marry Aglaya
      Ivanovna, not Nastasia Philipovna, or this fellow Ferdishenko will always
      be pointing the finger of scorn at you. You aren&rsquo;t afraid, I know; but I
      should always be afraid that I had ruined you, and that you would reproach
      me for it. As for what you say about my doing you honour by marrying
      you&mdash;well, Totski can tell you all about that. You had your eye on Aglaya,
      Gania, you know you had; and you might have married her if you had not
      come bargaining. You are all like this. You should choose, once for all,
      between disreputable women, and respectable ones, or you are sure to get
      mixed. Look at the general, how he&rsquo;s staring at me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is too horrible,&rdquo; said the general, starting to his feet. All were
      standing up now. Nastasia was absolutely beside herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very proud, in spite of what I am,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;You called me
      &lsquo;perfection&rsquo; just now, prince. A nice sort of perfection to throw up a
      prince and a million and a half of roubles in order to be able to boast of
      the fact afterwards! What sort of a wife should I make for you, after all
      I have said? Afanasy Ivanovitch, do you observe I have really and truly
      thrown away a million of roubles? And you thought that I should consider
      your wretched seventy-five thousand, with Gania thrown in for a husband, a
      paradise of bliss! Take your seventy-five thousand back, sir; you did not
      reach the hundred thousand. Rogojin cut a better dash than you did. I&rsquo;ll
      console Gania myself; I have an idea about that. But now I must be off!
      I&rsquo;ve been in prison for ten years. I&rsquo;m free at last! Well, Rogojin, what
      are you waiting for? Let&rsquo;s get ready and go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along!&rdquo; shouted Rogojin, beside himself with joy. &ldquo;Hey! all of you
      fellows! Wine! Round with it! Fill the glasses!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get away!&rdquo; he shouted frantically, observing that Daria Alexeyevna was
      approaching to protest against Nastasia&rsquo;s conduct. &ldquo;Get away, she&rsquo;s mine,
      everything&rsquo;s mine! She&rsquo;s a queen, get away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was panting with ecstasy. He walked round and round Nastasia Philipovna
      and told everybody to &ldquo;keep their distance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All the Rogojin company were now collected in the drawing-room; some were
      drinking, some laughed and talked: all were in the highest and wildest
      spirits. Ferdishenko was doing his best to unite himself to them; the
      general and Totski again made an attempt to go. Gania, too stood hat in
      hand ready to go; but seemed to be unable to tear his eyes away from the
      scene before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get out, keep your distance!&rdquo; shouted Rogojin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you shouting about there!&rdquo; cried Nastasia &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not yours yet. I
      may kick you out for all you know I haven&rsquo;t taken your money yet; there it
      all is on the table. Here, give me over that packet! Is there a hundred
      thousand roubles in that one packet? Pfu! what abominable stuff it looks!
      Oh! nonsense, Daria Alexeyevna; you surely did not expect me to ruin <i>him?</i>&rdquo;
       (indicating the prince). &ldquo;Fancy him nursing me! Why, he needs a nurse
      himself! The general, there, will be his nurse now, you&rsquo;ll see. Here,
      prince, look here! Your bride is accepting money. What a disreputable
      woman she must be! And you wished to marry her! What are you crying about?
      Is it a bitter dose? Never mind, you shall laugh yet. Trust to time.&rdquo; (In
      spite of these words there were two large tears rolling down Nastasia&rsquo;s
      own cheeks.) &ldquo;It&rsquo;s far better to think twice of it now than afterwards.
      Oh! you mustn&rsquo;t cry like that! There&rsquo;s Katia crying, too. What is it,
      Katia, dear? I shall leave you and Pasha a lot of things, I&rsquo;ve laid them
      out for you already; but good-bye, now. I made an honest girl like you
      serve a low woman like myself. It&rsquo;s better so, prince, it is indeed. You&rsquo;d
      begin to despise me afterwards&mdash;we should never be happy. Oh! you
      needn&rsquo;t swear, prince, I shan&rsquo;t believe you, you know. How foolish it
      would be, too! No, no; we&rsquo;d better say good-bye and part friends. I am a
      bit of a dreamer myself, and I used to dream of you once. Very often
      during those five years down at his estate I used to dream and think, and
      I always imagined just such a good, honest, foolish fellow as you, one who
      should come and say to me: &lsquo;You are an innocent woman, Nastasia
      Philipovna, and I adore you.&rsquo; I dreamt of you often. I used to think so
      much down there that I nearly went mad; and then this fellow here would
      come down. He would stay a couple of months out of the twelve, and
      disgrace and insult and deprave me, and then go; so that I longed to drown
      myself in the pond a thousand times over; but I did not dare do it. I
      hadn&rsquo;t the heart, and now&mdash;well, are you ready, Rogojin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ready&mdash;keep your distance, all of you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all ready,&rdquo; said several of his friends. &ldquo;The troikas [Sledges
      drawn by three horses abreast.] are at the door, bells and all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nastasia Philipovna seized the packet of bank-notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gania, I have an idea. I wish to recompense you&mdash;why should you lose
      all? Rogojin, would he crawl for three roubles as far as the
      Vassiliostrof?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, wouldn&rsquo;t he just!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, look here, Gania. I wish to look into your heart once more, for the
      last time. You&rsquo;ve worried me for the last three months&mdash;now it&rsquo;s my
      turn. Do you see this packet? It contains a hundred thousand roubles. Now,
      I&rsquo;m going to throw it into the fire, here&mdash;before all these
      witnesses. As soon as the fire catches hold of it, you put your hands into
      the fire and pick it out&mdash;without gloves, you know. You must have
      bare hands, and you must turn your sleeves up. Pull it out, I say, and
      it&rsquo;s all yours. You may burn your fingers a little, of course; but then
      it&rsquo;s a hundred thousand roubles, remember&mdash;it won&rsquo;t take you long to
      lay hold of it and snatch it out. I shall so much admire you if you put
      your hands into the fire for my money. All here present may be witnesses
      that the whole packet of money is yours if you get it out. If you don&rsquo;t
      get it out, it shall burn. I will let no one else come; away&mdash;get
      away, all of you&mdash;it&rsquo;s my money! Rogojin has bought me with it. Is it
      my money, Rogojin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my queen; it&rsquo;s your own money, my joy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get away then, all of you. I shall do as I like with my own&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      meddle! Ferdishenko, make up the fire, quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nastasia Philipovna, I can&rsquo;t; my hands won&rsquo;t obey me,&rdquo; said Ferdishenko,
      astounded and helpless with bewilderment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; cried Nastasia Philipovna, seizing the poker and raking a
      couple of logs together. No sooner did a tongue of flame burst out than
      she threw the packet of notes upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone gasped; some even crossed themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s mad&mdash;she&rsquo;s mad!&rdquo; was the cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oughtn&rsquo;t-oughtn&rsquo;t we to secure her?&rdquo; asked the general of Ptitsin, in a
      whisper; &ldquo;or shall we send for the authorities? Why, she&rsquo;s mad, isn&rsquo;t she&mdash;isn&rsquo;t
      she, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N-no, I hardly think she is actually mad,&rdquo; whispered Ptitsin, who was as
      white as his handkerchief, and trembling like a leaf. He could not take
      his eyes off the smouldering packet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s mad surely, isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; the general appealed to Totski.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you she wasn&rsquo;t an ordinary woman,&rdquo; replied the latter, who was as
      pale as anyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but, positively, you know&mdash;a hundred thousand roubles!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodness gracious! good heavens!&rdquo; came from all quarters of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      All now crowded round the fire and thronged to see what was going on;
      everyone lamented and gave vent to exclamations of horror and woe. Some
      jumped up on chairs in order to get a better view. Daria Alexeyevna ran
      into the next room and whispered excitedly to Katia and Pasha. The
      beautiful German disappeared altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lady! my sovereign!&rdquo; lamented Lebedeff, falling on his knees before
      Nastasia Philipovna, and stretching out his hands towards the fire; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
      a hundred thousand roubles, it is indeed, I packed it up myself, I saw the
      money! My queen, let me get into the fire after it&mdash;say the word&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
      put my whole grey head into the fire for it! I have a poor lame wife and
      thirteen children. My father died of starvation last week. Nastasia
      Philipovna, Nastasia Philipovna!&rdquo; The wretched little man wept, and
      groaned, and crawled towards the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Away, out of the way!&rdquo; cried Nastasia. &ldquo;Make room, all of you! Gania,
      what are you standing there for? Don&rsquo;t stand on ceremony. Put in your
      hand! There&rsquo;s your whole happiness smouldering away, look! Quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Gania had borne too much that day, and especially this evening, and he
      was not prepared for this last, quite unexpected trial.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd parted on each side of him and he was left face to face with
      Nastasia Philipovna, three paces from her. She stood by the fire and
      waited, with her intent gaze fixed upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gania stood before her, in his evening clothes, holding his white gloves
      and hat in his hand, speechless and motionless, with arms folded and eyes
      fixed on the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      A silly, meaningless smile played on his white, death-like lips. He could
      not take his eyes off the smouldering packet; but it appeared that
      something new had come to birth in his soul&mdash;as though he were vowing
      to himself that he would bear this trial. He did not move from his place.
      In a few seconds it became evident to all that he did not intend to rescue
      the money.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey! look at it, it&rsquo;ll burn in another minute or two!&rdquo; cried Nastasia
      Philipovna. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll hang yourself afterwards, you know, if it does! I&rsquo;m
      not joking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fire, choked between a couple of smouldering pieces of wood, had died
      down for the first few moments after the packet was thrown upon it. But a
      little tongue of fire now began to lick the paper from below, and soon,
      gathering courage, mounted the sides of the parcel, and crept around it.
      In another moment, the whole of it burst into flames, and the exclamations
      of woe and horror were redoubled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nastasia Philipovna!&rdquo; lamented Lebedeff again, straining towards the
      fireplace; but Rogojin dragged him away, and pushed him to the rear once
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole of Rogojin&rsquo;s being was concentrated in one rapturous gaze of
      ecstasy. He could not take his eyes off Nastasia. He stood drinking her
      in, as it were. He was in the seventh heaven of delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, what a queen she is!&rdquo; he ejaculated, every other minute, throwing out
      the remark for anyone who liked to catch it. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the sort of woman for
      me! Which of you would think of doing a thing like that, you blackguards,
      eh?&rdquo; he yelled. He was hopelessly and wildly beside himself with ecstasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince watched the whole scene, silent and dejected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pull it out with my teeth for one thousand,&rdquo; said Ferdishenko.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So would I,&rdquo; said another, from behind, &ldquo;with pleasure. Devil take the
      thing!&rdquo; he added, in a tempest of despair, &ldquo;it will all be burnt up in a
      minute&mdash;It&rsquo;s burning, it&rsquo;s burning!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s burning, it&rsquo;s burning!&rdquo; cried all, thronging nearer and nearer to
      the fire in their excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gania, don&rsquo;t be a fool! I tell you for the last time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get on, quick!&rdquo; shrieked Ferdishenko, rushing wildly up to Gania, and
      trying to drag him to the fire by the sleeve of his coat. &ldquo;Get it, you
      dummy, it&rsquo;s burning away fast! Oh&mdash;<i>damn</i> the thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gania hurled Ferdishenko from him; then he turned sharp round and made for
      the door. But he had not gone a couple of steps when he tottered and fell
      to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s fainted!&rdquo; the cry went round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the money&rsquo;s burning still,&rdquo; Lebedeff lamented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Burning for nothing,&rdquo; shouted others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Katia-Pasha! Bring him some water!&rdquo; cried Nastasia Philipovna. Then she
      took the tongs and fished out the packet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearly the whole of the outer covering was burned away, but it was soon
      evident that the contents were hardly touched. The packet had been wrapped
      in a threefold covering of newspaper, and the notes were safe. All
      breathed more freely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some dirty little thousand or so may be touched,&rdquo; said Lebedeff,
      immensely relieved, &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s very little harm done, after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all his&mdash;the whole packet is for him, do you hear&mdash;all of
      you?&rdquo; cried Nastasia Philipovna, placing the packet by the side of Gania.
      &ldquo;He restrained himself, and didn&rsquo;t go after it; so his self-respect is
      greater than his thirst for money. All right&mdash;he&rsquo;ll come to directly&mdash;he
      must have the packet or he&rsquo;ll cut his throat afterwards. There! He&rsquo;s
      coming to himself. General, Totski, all of you, did you hear me? The money
      is all Gania&rsquo;s. I give it to him, fully conscious of my action, as
      recompense for&mdash;well, for anything he thinks best. Tell him so. Let
      it lie here beside him. Off we go, Rogojin! Goodbye, prince. I have seen a
      man for the first time in my life. Goodbye, Afanasy Ivanovitch&mdash;and
      thanks!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Rogojin gang followed their leader and Nastasia Philipovna to the
      entrance-hall, laughing and shouting and whistling.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the hall the servants were waiting, and handed her her fur cloak.
      Martha, the cook, ran in from the kitchen. Nastasia kissed them all round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you really throwing us all over, little mother? Where, where are you
      going to? And on your birthday, too!&rdquo; cried the four girls, crying over
      her and kissing her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going out into the world, Katia; perhaps I shall be a laundress. I
      don&rsquo;t know. No more of Afanasy Ivanovitch, anyhow. Give him my respects.
      Don&rsquo;t think badly of me, girls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince hurried down to the front gate where the party were settling
      into the troikas, all the bells tinkling a merry accompaniment the while.
      The general caught him up on the stairs:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prince, prince!&rdquo; he cried, seizing hold of his arm, &ldquo;recollect yourself!
      Drop her, prince! You see what sort of a woman she is. I am speaking to
      you like a father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince glanced at him, but said nothing. He shook himself free, and
      rushed on downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general was just in time to see the prince take the first sledge he
      could get, and, giving the order to Ekaterinhof, start off in pursuit of
      the troikas. Then the general&rsquo;s fine grey horse dragged that worthy home,
      with some new thoughts, and some new hopes and calculations developing in
      his brain, and with the pearls in his pocket, for he had not forgotten to
      bring them along with him, being a man of business. Amid his new thoughts
      and ideas there came, once or twice, the image of Nastasia Philipovna. The
      general sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, really sorry,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a ruined woman. Mad! mad!
      However, the prince is not for Nastasia Philipovna now,&mdash;perhaps it&rsquo;s
      as well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two more of Nastasia&rsquo;s guests, who walked a short distance together,
      indulged in high moral sentiments of a similar nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, Totski, this is all very like what they say goes on among
      the Japanese?&rdquo; said Ptitsin. &ldquo;The offended party there, they say, marches
      off to his insulter and says to him, &lsquo;You insulted me, so I have come to
      rip myself open before your eyes;&rsquo; and with these words he does actually
      rip his stomach open before his enemy, and considers, doubtless, that he
      is having all possible and necessary satisfaction and revenge. There are
      strange characters in the world, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m! and you think there was something of this sort here, do you? Dear me&mdash;a
      very remarkable comparison, you know! But you must have observed, my dear
      Ptitsin, that I did all I possibly could. I could do no more than I did.
      And you must admit that there are some rare qualities in this woman. I
      felt I could not speak in that Bedlam, or I should have been tempted to
      cry out, when she reproached me, that she herself was my best
      justification. Such a woman could make anyone forget all reason&mdash;everything!
      Even that moujik, Rogojin, you saw, brought her a hundred thousand
      roubles! Of course, all that happened tonight was ephemeral, fantastic,
      unseemly&mdash;yet it lacked neither colour nor originality. My God! What
      might not have been made of such a character combined with such beauty!
      Yet in spite of all efforts&mdash;in spite of all education, even&mdash;all
      those gifts are wasted! She is an uncut diamond.... I have often said so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Afanasy Ivanovitch heaved a deep sigh.
    </p>

    <h2>
      PART II
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Two days after the strange conclusion to Nastasia Philipovna&rsquo;s birthday
      party, with the record of which we concluded the first part of this story,
      Prince Muishkin hurriedly left St. Petersburg for Moscow, in order to see
      after some business connected with the receipt of his unexpected fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was said that there were other reasons for his hurried departure; but
      as to this, and as to his movements in Moscow, and as to his prolonged
      absence from St. Petersburg, we are able to give very little information.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince was away for six months, and even those who were most
      interested in his destiny were able to pick up very little news about him
      all that while. True, certain rumours did reach his friends, but these
      were both strange and rare, and each one contradicted the last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course the Epanchin family was much interested in his movements, though
      he had not had time to bid them farewell before his departure. The
      general, however, had had an opportunity of seeing him once or twice since
      the eventful evening, and had spoken very seriously with him; but though
      he had seen the prince, as I say, he told his family nothing about the
      circumstance. In fact, for a month or so after his departure it was
      considered not the thing to mention the prince&rsquo;s name in the Epanchin
      household. Only Mrs. Epanchin, at the commencement of this period, had
      announced that she had been &ldquo;cruelly mistaken in the prince!&rdquo; and a day or
      two after, she had added, evidently alluding to him, but not mentioning
      his name, that it was an unalterable characteristic of hers to be mistaken
      in people. Then once more, ten days later, after some passage of arms with
      one of her daughters, she had remarked sententiously. &ldquo;We have had enough
      of mistakes. I shall be more careful in future!&rdquo; However, it was
      impossible to avoid remarking that there was some sense of oppression in
      the household&mdash;something unspoken, but felt; something strained. All
      the members of the family wore frowning looks. The general was unusually
      busy; his family hardly ever saw him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the girls, nothing was said openly, at all events; and probably very
      little in private. They were proud damsels, and were not always perfectly
      confidential even among themselves. But they understood each other
      thoroughly at the first word on all occasions; very often at the first
      glance, so that there was no need of much talking as a rule.
    </p>
    <p>
      One fact, at least, would have been perfectly plain to an outsider, had
      any such person been on the spot; and that was, that the prince had made a
      very considerable impression upon the family, in spite of the fact that he
      had but once been inside the house, and then only for a short time. Of
      course, if analyzed, this impression might have proved to be nothing more
      than a feeling of curiosity; but be it what it might, there it undoubtedly
      was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little by little, the rumours spread about town became lost in a maze of
      uncertainty. It was said that some foolish young prince, name unknown, had
      suddenly come into possession of a gigantic fortune, and had married a
      French ballet dancer. This was contradicted, and the rumour circulated
      that it was a young merchant who had come into the enormous fortune and
      married the great ballet dancer, and that at the wedding the drunken young
      fool had burned seventy thousand roubles at a candle out of pure bravado.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, all these rumours soon died down, to which circumstance certain
      facts largely contributed. For instance, the whole of the Rogojin troop
      had departed, with him at their head, for Moscow. This was exactly a week
      after a dreadful orgy at the Ekaterinhof gardens, where Nastasia
      Philipovna had been present. It became known that after this orgy Nastasia
      Philipovna had entirely disappeared, and that she had since been traced to
      Moscow; so that the exodus of the Rogojin band was found consistent with
      this report.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were rumours current as to Gania, too; but circumstances soon
      contradicted these. He had fallen seriously ill, and his illness precluded
      his appearance in society, and even at business, for over a month. As soon
      as he had recovered, however, he threw up his situation in the public
      company under General Epanchin&rsquo;s direction, for some unknown reason, and
      the post was given to another. He never went near the Epanchins&rsquo; house at
      all, and was exceedingly irritable and depressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Varvara Ardalionovna married Ptitsin this winter, and it was said that the
      fact of Gania&rsquo;s retirement from business was the ultimate cause of the
      marriage, since Gania was now not only unable to support his family, but
      even required help himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may mention that Gania was no longer mentioned in the Epanchin
      household any more than the prince was; but that a certain circumstance in
      connection with the fatal evening at Nastasia&rsquo;s house became known to the
      general, and, in fact, to all the family the very next day. This fact was
      that Gania had come home that night, but had refused to go to bed. He had
      awaited the prince&rsquo;s return from Ekaterinhof with feverish impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the latter&rsquo;s arrival, at six in the morning, Gania had gone to him in
      his room, bringing with him the singed packet of money, which he had
      insisted that the prince should return to Nastasia Philipovna without
      delay. It was said that when Gania entered the prince&rsquo;s room, he came with
      anything but friendly feelings, and in a condition of despair and misery;
      but that after a short conversation, he had stayed on for a couple of
      hours with him, sobbing continuously and bitterly the whole time. They had
      parted upon terms of cordial friendship.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Epanchins heard about this, as well as about the episode at Nastasia
      Philipovna&rsquo;s. It was strange, perhaps, that the facts should become so
      quickly, and fairly accurately, known. As far as Gania was concerned, it
      might have been supposed that the news had come through Varvara
      Ardalionovna, who had suddenly become a frequent visitor of the Epanchin
      girls, greatly to their mother&rsquo;s surprise. But though Varvara had seen
      fit, for some reason, to make friends with them, it was not likely that
      she would have talked to them about her brother. She had plenty of pride,
      in spite of the fact that in thus acting she was seeking intimacy with
      people who had practically shown her brother the door. She and the
      Epanchin girls had been acquainted in childhood, although of late they had
      met but rarely. Even now Varvara hardly ever appeared in the drawing-room,
      but would slip in by a back way. Lizabetha Prokofievna, who disliked
      Varvara, although she had a great respect for her mother, was much annoyed
      by this sudden intimacy, and put it down to the general &ldquo;contrariness&rdquo; of
      her daughters, who were &ldquo;always on the lookout for some new way of
      opposing her.&rdquo; Nevertheless, Varvara continued her visits.
    </p>
    <p>
      A month after Muishkin&rsquo;s departure, Mrs. Epanchin received a letter from
      her old friend Princess Bielokonski (who had lately left for Moscow),
      which letter put her into the greatest good humour. She did not divulge
      its contents either to her daughters or the general, but her conduct
      towards the former became affectionate in the extreme. She even made some
      sort of confession to them, but they were unable to understand what it was
      about. She actually relaxed towards the general a little&mdash;he had been
      long disgraced&mdash;and though she managed to quarrel with them all the
      next day, yet she soon came round, and from her general behaviour it was
      to be concluded that she had had good news of some sort, which she would
      like, but could not make up her mind, to disclose.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, a week later she received another letter from the same source,
      and at last resolved to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      She solemnly announced that she had heard from old Princess Bielokonski,
      who had given her most comforting news about &ldquo;that queer young prince.&rdquo;
       Her friend had hunted him up, and found that all was going well with him.
      He had since called in person upon her, making an extremely favourable
      impression, for the princess had received him each day since, and had
      introduced him into several good houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girls could see that their mother concealed a great deal from them,
      and left out large pieces of the letter in reading it to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the ice was broken, and it suddenly became possible to mention
      the prince&rsquo;s name again. And again it became evident how very strong was
      the impression the young man had made in the household by his one visit
      there. Mrs. Epanchin was surprised at the effect which the news from
      Moscow had upon the girls, and they were no less surprised that after
      solemnly remarking that her most striking characteristic was &ldquo;being
      mistaken in people&rdquo; she should have troubled to obtain for the prince the
      favour and protection of so powerful an old lady as the Princess
      Bielokonski. As soon as the ice was thus broken, the general lost no time
      in showing that he, too, took the greatest interest in the subject. He
      admitted that he was interested, but said that it was merely in the
      business side of the question. It appeared that, in the interests of the
      prince, he had made arrangements in Moscow for a careful watch to be kept
      upon the prince&rsquo;s business affairs, and especially upon Salaskin. All that
      had been said as to the prince being an undoubted heir to a fortune turned
      out to be perfectly true; but the fortune proved to be much smaller than
      was at first reported. The estate was considerably encumbered with debts;
      creditors turned up on all sides, and the prince, in spite of all advice
      and entreaty, insisted upon managing all matters of claim himself&mdash;which,
      of course, meant satisfying everybody all round, although half the claims
      were absolutely fraudulent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Epanchin confirmed all this. She said the princess had written to
      much the same effect, and added that there was no curing a fool. But it
      was plain, from her expression of face, how strongly she approved of this
      particular young fool&rsquo;s doings. In conclusion, the general observed that
      his wife took as great an interest in the prince as though he were her own
      son; and that she had commenced to be especially affectionate towards
      Aglaya was a self-evident fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this caused the general to look grave and important. But, alas! this
      agreeable state of affairs very soon changed once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      A couple of weeks went by, and suddenly the general and his wife were once
      more gloomy and silent, and the ice was as firm as ever. The fact was, the
      general, who had heard first, how Nastasia Philipovna had fled to Moscow
      and had been discovered there by Rogojin; that she had then disappeared
      once more, and been found again by Rogojin, and how after that she had
      almost promised to marry him, now received news that she had once more
      disappeared, almost on the very day fixed for her wedding, flying
      somewhere into the interior of Russia this time, and that Prince Muishkin
      had left all his affairs in the hands of Salaskin and disappeared also&mdash;but
      whether he was with Nastasia, or had only set off in search of her, was
      unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lizabetha Prokofievna received confirmatory news from the princess&mdash;and
      alas, two months after the prince&rsquo;s first departure from St. Petersburg,
      darkness and mystery once more enveloped his whereabouts and actions, and
      in the Epanchin family the ice of silence once more formed over the
      subject. Varia, however, informed the girls of what had happened, she
      having received the news from Ptitsin, who generally knew more than most
      people.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make an end, we may say that there were many changes in the Epanchin
      household in the spring, so that it was not difficult to forget the
      prince, who sent no news of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Epanchin family had at last made up their minds to spend the summer
      abroad, all except the general, who could not waste time in &ldquo;travelling
      for enjoyment,&rdquo; of course. This arrangement was brought about by the
      persistence of the girls, who insisted that they were never allowed to go
      abroad because their parents were too anxious to marry them off. Perhaps
      their parents had at last come to the conclusion that husbands might be
      found abroad, and that a summer&rsquo;s travel might bear fruit. The marriage
      between Alexandra and Totski had been broken off. Since the prince&rsquo;s
      departure from St. Petersburg no more had been said about it; the subject
      had been dropped without ceremony, much to the joy of Mrs. General, who,
      announced that she was &ldquo;ready to cross herself with both hands&rdquo; in
      gratitude for the escape. The general, however, regretted Totski for a
      long while. &ldquo;Such a fortune!&rdquo; he sighed, &ldquo;and such a good, easy-going
      fellow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a time it became known that Totski had married a French marquise,
      and was to be carried off by her to Paris, and then to Brittany.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; thought the general, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s lost to us for good, now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So the Epanchins prepared to depart for the summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now another circumstance occurred, which changed all the plans once
      more, and again the intended journey was put off, much to the delight of
      the general and his spouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      A certain Prince S&mdash;&mdash; arrived in St. Petersburg from Moscow, an
      eminent and honourable young man. He was one of those active persons who
      always find some good work with which to employ themselves. Without
      forcing himself upon the public notice, modest and unobtrusive, this young
      prince was concerned with much that happened in the world in general.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had served, at first, in one of the civil departments, had then
      attended to matters connected with the local government of provincial
      towns, and had of late been a corresponding member of several important
      scientific societies. He was a man of excellent family and solid means,
      about thirty-five years of age.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prince S&mdash;&mdash; made the acquaintance of the general&rsquo;s family, and
      Adelaida, the second girl, made a great impression upon him. Towards the
      spring he proposed to her, and she accepted him. The general and his wife
      were delighted. The journey abroad was put off, and the wedding was fixed
      for a day not very distant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trip abroad might have been enjoyed later on by Mrs. Epanchin and her
      two remaining daughters, but for another circumstance.
    </p>
    <p>
      It so happened that Prince S&mdash;&mdash; introduced a distant relation
      of his own into the Epanchin family&mdash;one Evgenie Pavlovitch, a young
      officer of about twenty-eight years of age, whose conquests among the
      ladies in Moscow had been proverbial. This young gentleman no sooner set
      eyes on Aglaya than he became a frequent visitor at the house. He was
      witty, well-educated, and extremely wealthy, as the general very soon
      discovered. His past reputation was the only thing against him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing was said; there were not even any hints dropped; but still, it
      seemed better to the parents to say nothing more about going abroad this
      season, at all events. Aglaya herself perhaps was of a different opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this happened just before the second appearance of our hero upon the
      scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time, to judge from appearances, poor Prince Muishkin had been
      quite forgotten in St. Petersburg. If he had appeared suddenly among his
      acquaintances, he would have been received as one from the skies; but we
      must just glance at one more fact before we conclude this preface.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colia Ivolgin, for some time after the prince&rsquo;s departure, continued his
      old life. That is, he went to school, looked after his father, helped
      Varia in the house, and ran her errands, and went frequently to see his
      friend, Hippolyte.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lodgers had disappeared very quickly&mdash;Ferdishenko soon after the
      events at Nastasia Philipovna&rsquo;s, while the prince went to Moscow, as we
      know. Gania and his mother went to live with Varia and Ptitsin immediately
      after the latter&rsquo;s wedding, while the general was housed in a debtor&rsquo;s
      prison by reason of certain IOU&rsquo;s given to the captain&rsquo;s widow under the
      impression that they would never be formally used against him. This unkind
      action much surprised poor Ardalion Alexandrovitch, the victim, as he
      called himself, of an &ldquo;unbounded trust in the nobility of the human
      heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he signed those notes of hand he never dreamt that they would be a
      source of future trouble. The event showed that he was mistaken. &ldquo;Trust in
      anyone after this! Have the least confidence in man or woman!&rdquo; he cried in
      bitter tones, as he sat with his new friends in prison, and recounted to
      them his favourite stories of the siege of Kars, and the resuscitated
      soldier. On the whole, he accommodated himself very well to his new
      position. Ptitsin and Varia declared that he was in the right place, and
      Gania was of the same opinion. The only person who deplored his fate was
      poor Nina Alexandrovna, who wept bitter tears over him, to the great
      surprise of her household, and, though always in feeble health, made a
      point of going to see him as often as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the general&rsquo;s &ldquo;mishap,&rdquo; as Colia called it, and the marriage of his
      sister, the boy had quietly possessed himself of far more freedom. His
      relations saw little of him, for he rarely slept at home. He made many new
      friends; and was moreover, a frequent visitor at the debtor&rsquo;s prison, to
      which he invariably accompanied his mother. Varia, who used to be always
      correcting him, never spoke to him now on the subject of his frequent
      absences, and the whole household was surprised to see Gania, in spite of
      his depression, on quite friendly terms with his brother. This was
      something new, for Gania had been wont to look upon Colia as a kind of
      errand-boy, treating him with contempt, threatening to &ldquo;pull his ears,&rdquo;
       and in general driving him almost wild with irritation. It seemed now that
      Gania really needed his brother, and the latter, for his part, felt as if
      he could forgive Gania much since he had returned the hundred thousand
      roubles offered to him by Nastasia Philipovna. Three months after the
      departure of the prince, the Ivolgin family discovered that Colia had made
      acquaintance with the Epanchins, and was on very friendly terms with the
      daughters. Varia heard of it first, though Colia had not asked her to
      introduce him. Little by little the family grew quite fond of him. Madame
      Epanchin at first looked on him with disdain, and received him coldly, but
      in a short time he grew to please her, because, as she said, he &ldquo;was
      candid and no flatterer&rdquo;&mdash;a very true description. From the
      first he put himself on an equality with his new friends, and though he
      sometimes read newspapers and books to the mistress of the house, it was
      simply because he liked to be useful.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, however, he and Lizabetha Prokofievna quarrelled seriously about
      the &ldquo;woman question,&rdquo; in the course of a lively discussion on that burning
      subject. He told her that she was a tyrant, and that he would never set
      foot in her house again. It may seem incredible, but a day or two after,
      Madame Epanchin sent a servant with a note begging him to return, and
      Colia, without standing on his dignity, did so at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aglaya was the only one of the family whose good graces he could not gain,
      and who always spoke to him haughtily, but it so happened that the boy one
      day succeeded in giving the proud maiden a surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was about Easter, when, taking advantage of a momentary tête-à-tête
      Colia handed Aglaya a letter, remarking that he &ldquo;had orders to deliver it
      to her privately.&rdquo; She stared at him in amazement, but he did not wait to
      hear what she had to say, and went out. Aglaya broke the seal, and read as
      follows:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Once you did me the honour of giving me your confidence. Perhaps you
        have quite forgotten me now! How is it that I am writing to you? I do
        not know; but I am conscious of an irresistible desire to remind you of
        my existence, especially you. How many times I have needed all three of
        you; but only you have dwelt always in my mind&rsquo;s eye. I need you&mdash;I
        need you very much. I will not write about myself. I have nothing to
        tell you. But I long for you to be happy. <i>Are</i> you happy? That is
        all I wished to say to you&mdash;Your brother,
      </p>
      <p class="sig sc">
        &ldquo;Pr. L. Muishkin.&rdquo;
       </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      On reading this short and disconnected note, Aglaya suddenly blushed all
      over, and became very thoughtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be difficult to describe her thoughts at that moment. One of them
      was, &ldquo;Shall I show it to anyone?&rdquo; But she was ashamed to show it. So she
      ended by hiding it in her table drawer, with a very strange, ironical
      smile upon her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day, she took it out, and put it into a large book, as she usually
      did with papers which she wanted to be able to find easily. She laughed
      when, about a week later, she happened to notice the name of the book, and
      saw that it was Don Quixote, but it would be difficult to say exactly why.
    </p>
    <p>
      I cannot say, either, whether she showed the letter to her sisters.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when she had read it herself once more, it suddenly struck her that
      surely that conceited boy, Colia, had not been the one chosen
      correspondent of the prince all this while. She determined to ask him, and
      did so with an exaggerated show of carelessness. He informed her haughtily
      that though he had given the prince his permanent address when the latter
      left town, and had offered his services, the prince had never before given
      him any commission to perform, nor had he written until the following
      lines arrived, with Aglaya&rsquo;s letter. Aglaya took the note, and read it.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &ldquo;<span class="sc">Dear Colia</span>,&mdash;Please be so kind as to give
        the enclosed sealed letter to Aglaya Ivanovna. Keep well&mdash;Ever your
        loving,
      </p>
      <p class="sig sc">
        &ldquo;Pr. L. Muishkin.&rdquo;
       </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems absurd to trust a little pepper-box like you,&rdquo; said Aglaya, as
      she returned the note, and walked past the &ldquo;pepper-box&rdquo; with an expression
      of great contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was more than Colia could bear. He had actually borrowed Gania&rsquo;s new
      green tie for the occasion, without saying why he wanted it, in order to
      impress her. He was very deeply mortified.
    </p>
    <h3>
      II.
    </h3>
    <p>
      It was the beginning of June, and for a whole week the weather in St.
      Petersburg had been magnificent. The Epanchins had a luxurious
      country-house at Pavlofsk, [One of the fashionable summer resorts near St.
      Petersburg.] and to this spot Mrs. Epanchin determined to proceed without
      further delay. In a couple of days all was ready, and the family had left
      town. A day or two after this removal to Pavlofsk, Prince Muishkin arrived
      in St. Petersburg by the morning train from Moscow. No one met him; but,
      as he stepped out of the carriage, he suddenly became aware of two
      strangely glowing eyes fixed upon him from among the crowd that met the
      train. On endeavouring to re-discover the eyes, and see to whom they
      belonged, he could find nothing to guide him. It must have been a
      hallucination. But the disagreeable impression remained, and without this,
      the prince was sad and thoughtful already, and seemed to be much
      preoccupied.
    </p>
    <p>
      His cab took him to a small and bad hotel near the Litaynaya. Here he
      engaged a couple of rooms, dark and badly furnished. He washed and
      changed, and hurriedly left the hotel again, as though anxious to waste no
      time. Anyone who now saw him for the first time since he left Petersburg
      would judge that he had improved vastly so far as his exterior was
      concerned. His clothes certainly were very different; they were more
      fashionable, perhaps even too much so, and anyone inclined to mockery
      might have found something to smile at in his appearance. But what is
      there that people will not smile at?
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince took a cab and drove to a street near the Nativity, where he
      soon discovered the house he was seeking. It was a small wooden villa, and
      he was struck by its attractive and clean appearance; it stood in a
      pleasant little garden, full of flowers. The windows looking on the street
      were open, and the sound of a voice, reading aloud or making a speech,
      came through them. It rose at times to a shout, and was interrupted
      occasionally by bursts of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prince Muishkin entered the court-yard, and ascended the steps. A cook
      with her sleeves turned up to the elbows opened the door. The visitor
      asked if Mr. Lebedeff were at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is in there,&rdquo; said she, pointing to the salon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room had a blue wall-paper, and was well, almost pretentiously,
      furnished, with its round table, its divan, and its bronze clock under a
      glass shade. There was a narrow pier-glass against the wall, and a
      chandelier adorned with lustres hung by a bronze chain from the ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the prince entered, Lebedeff was standing in the middle of the room,
      his back to the door. He was in his shirt-sleeves, on account of the
      extreme heat, and he seemed to have just reached the peroration of his
      speech, and was impressively beating his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      His audience consisted of a youth of about fifteen years of age with a
      clever face, who had a book in his hand, though he was not reading; a
      young lady of twenty, in deep mourning, stood near him with an infant in
      her arms; another girl of thirteen, also in black, was laughing loudly,
      her mouth wide open; and on the sofa lay a handsome young man, with black
      hair and eyes, and a suspicion of beard and whiskers. He frequently
      interrupted the speaker and argued with him, to the great delight of the
      others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lukian Timofeyovitch! Lukian Timofeyovitch! Here&rsquo;s someone to see you!
      Look here!... a gentleman to speak to you!... Well, it&rsquo;s not my fault!&rdquo;
       and the cook turned and went away red with anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lebedeff started, and at sight of the prince stood like a statue for a
      moment. Then he moved up to him with an ingratiating smile, but stopped
      short again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prince! ex-ex-excellency!&rdquo; he stammered. Then suddenly he ran towards the
      girl with the infant, a movement so unexpected by her that she staggered
      and fell back, but next moment he was threatening the other child, who was
      standing, still laughing, in the doorway. She screamed, and ran towards
      the kitchen. Lebedeff stamped his foot angrily; then, seeing the prince
      regarding him with amazement, he murmured apologetically&mdash;&ldquo;Pardon to
      show respect!... he-he!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quite wrong...&rdquo; began the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At once... at once... in one moment!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rushed like a whirlwind from the room, and Muishkin looked inquiringly
      at the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were all laughing, and the guest joined in the chorus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has gone to get his coat,&rdquo; said the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How annoying!&rdquo; exclaimed the prince. &ldquo;I thought... Tell me, is he...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think he is drunk?&rdquo; cried the young man on the sofa. &ldquo;Not in the
      least. He&rsquo;s only had three or four small glasses, perhaps five; but what
      is that? The usual thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the prince opened his mouth to answer, he was interrupted by the girl,
      whose sweet face wore an expression of absolute frankness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He never drinks much in the morning; if you have come to talk business
      with him, do it now. It is the best time. He sometimes comes back drunk in
      the evening; but just now he passes the greater part of the evening in
      tears, and reads passages of Holy Scripture aloud, because our mother died
      five weeks ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt he ran off because he did not know what to say to you,&rdquo; said the
      youth on the divan. &ldquo;I bet he is trying to cheat you, and is thinking how
      best to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then Lebedeff returned, having put on his coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five weeks!&rdquo; said he, wiping his eyes. &ldquo;Only five weeks! Poor orphans!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why wear a coat in holes,&rdquo; asked the girl, &ldquo;when your new one is
      hanging behind the door? Did you not see it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold your tongue, dragon-fly!&rdquo; he scolded. &ldquo;What a plague you are!&rdquo; He
      stamped his foot irritably, but she only laughed, and answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you trying to frighten me? I am not Tania, you know, and I don&rsquo;t
      intend to run away. Look, you are waking Lubotchka, and she will have
      convulsions again. Why do you shout like that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well! I won&rsquo;t again,&rdquo; said the master of the house, his anxiety
      getting the better of his temper. He went up to his daughter, and looked
      at the child in her arms, anxiously making the sign of the cross over her
      three times. &ldquo;God bless her! God bless her!&rdquo; he cried with emotion. &ldquo;This
      little creature is my daughter Luboff,&rdquo; addressing the prince. &ldquo;My wife,
      Helena, died&mdash;at her birth; and this is my big daughter Vera, in
      mourning, as you see; and this, this, oh, this,&rdquo; pointing to the young man
      on the divan...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, go on! never mind me!&rdquo; mocked the other. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellency! Have you read that account of the murder of the Zemarin
      family, in the newspaper?&rdquo; cried Lebedeff, all of a sudden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Muishkin, with some surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that is the murderer! It is he&mdash;in fact&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked the visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am speaking allegorically, of course; but he will be the murderer of a
      Zemarin family in the future. He is getting ready. ...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They all laughed, and the thought crossed the prince&rsquo;s mind that perhaps
      Lebedeff was really trifling in this way because he foresaw inconvenient
      questions, and wanted to gain time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a traitor! a conspirator!&rdquo; shouted Lebedeff, who seemed to have
      lost all control over himself. &ldquo;A monster! a slanderer! Ought I to treat
      him as a nephew, the son of my sister Anisia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! do be quiet! You must be drunk! He has taken it into his head to play
      the lawyer, prince, and he practices speechifying, and is always repeating
      his eloquent pleadings to his children. And who do you think was his last
      client? An old woman who had been robbed of five hundred roubles, her all,
      by some rogue of a usurer, besought him to take up her case, instead of
      which he defended the usurer himself, a Jew named Zeidler, because this
      Jew promised to give him fifty roubles....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was to be fifty if I won the case, only five if I lost,&rdquo; interrupted
      Lebedeff, speaking in a low tone, a great contrast to his earlier manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! naturally he came to grief: the law is not administered as it used
      to be, and he only got laughed at for his pains. But he was much pleased
      with himself in spite of that. &lsquo;Most learned judge!&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;picture
      this unhappy man, crippled by age and infirmities, who gains his living by
      honourable toil&mdash;picture him, I repeat, robbed of his all, of his
      last mouthful; remember, I entreat you, the words of that learned
      legislator, &ldquo;Let mercy and justice alike rule the courts of law.&rdquo;&rsquo; Now,
      would you believe it, excellency, every morning he recites this speech to
      us from beginning to end, exactly as he spoke it before the magistrate.
      To-day we have heard it for the fifth time. He was just starting again
      when you arrived, so much does he admire it. He is now preparing to
      undertake another case. I think, by the way, that you are Prince Muishkin?
      Colia tells me you are the cleverest man he has ever known....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The cleverest in the world,&rdquo; interrupted his uncle hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not pay much attention to that opinion,&rdquo; continued the young man
      calmly. &ldquo;Colia is very fond of you, but he,&rdquo; pointing to Lebedeff, &ldquo;is
      flattering you. I can assure you I have no intention of flattering you, or
      anyone else, but at least you have some common-sense. Well, will you judge
      between us? Shall we ask the prince to act as arbitrator?&rdquo; he went on,
      addressing his uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so glad you chanced to come here, prince.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I agree,&rdquo; said Lebedeff, firmly, looking round involuntarily at his
      daughter, who had come nearer, and was listening attentively to the
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it all about?&rdquo; asked the prince, frowning. His head ached, and he
      felt sure that Lebedeff was trying to cheat him in some way, and only
      talking to put off the explanation that he had come for.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you all the story. I am his nephew; he did speak the truth
      there, although he is generally telling lies. I am at the University, and
      have not yet finished my course. I mean to do so, and I shall, for I have
      a determined character. I must, however, find something to do for the
      present, and therefore I have got employment on the railway at twenty-four
      roubles a month. I admit that my uncle has helped me once or twice before.
      Well, I had twenty roubles in my pocket, and I gambled them away. Can you
      believe that I should be so low, so base, as to lose money in that way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the man who won it is a rogue, a rogue whom you ought not to have
      paid!&rdquo; cried Lebedeff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he is a rogue, but I was obliged to pay him,&rdquo; said the young man.
      &ldquo;As to his being a rogue, he is assuredly that, and I am not saying it
      because he beat you. He is an ex-lieutenant, prince, dismissed from the
      service, a teacher of boxing, and one of Rogojin&rsquo;s followers. They are all
      lounging about the pavements now that Rogojin has turned them off. Of
      course, the worst of it is that, knowing he was a rascal, and a
      card-sharper, I none the less played palki with him, and risked my last
      rouble. To tell the truth, I thought to myself, &lsquo;If I lose, I will go to
      my uncle, and I am sure he will not refuse to help me.&rsquo; Now that was
      base&mdash;cowardly and base!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is so,&rdquo; observed Lebedeff quietly; &ldquo;cowardly and base.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, wait a bit, before you begin to triumph,&rdquo; said the nephew
      viciously; for the words seemed to irritate him. &ldquo;He is delighted! I came
      to him here and told him everything: I acted honourably, for I did not
      excuse myself. I spoke most severely of my conduct, as everyone here can
      witness. But I must smarten myself up before I take up my new post, for I
      am really like a tramp. Just look at my boots! I cannot possibly appear
      like this, and if I am not at the bureau at the time appointed, the job
      will be given to someone else; and I shall have to try for another. Now I
      only beg for fifteen roubles, and I give my word that I will never ask him
      for anything again. I am also ready to promise to repay my debt in three
      months&rsquo; time, and I will keep my word, even if I have to live on bread and
      water. My salary will amount to seventy-five roubles in three months. The
      sum I now ask, added to what I have borrowed already, will make a total of
      about thirty-five roubles, so you see I shall have enough to pay him and
      confound him! if he wants interest, he shall have that, too! Haven&rsquo;t I
      always paid back the money he lent me before? Why should he be so mean
      now? He grudges my having paid that lieutenant; there can be no other
      reason! That&rsquo;s the kind he is&mdash;a dog in the manger!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he won&rsquo;t go away!&rdquo; cried Lebedeff. &ldquo;He has installed himself here,
      and here he remains!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have told you already, that I will not go away until I have got what I
      ask. Why are you smiling, prince? You look as if you disapproved of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not smiling, but I really think you are in the wrong, somewhat,&rdquo;
       replied Muishkin, reluctantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t shuffle! Say plainly that you think that I am quite wrong, without
      any &lsquo;somewhat&rsquo;! Why &lsquo;somewhat&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will say you are quite wrong, if you wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I wish! That&rsquo;s good, I must say! Do you think I am deceived as to the
      flagrant impropriety of my conduct? I am quite aware that his money is his
      own, and that my action&mdash;is much like an attempt at extortion. But
      you-you don&rsquo;t know what life is! If people don&rsquo;t learn by experience, they
      never understand. They must be taught. My intentions are perfectly honest;
      on my conscience he will lose nothing, and I will pay back the money with
      interest. Added to which he has had the moral satisfaction of seeing me
      disgraced. What does he want more? and what is he good for if he never
      helps anyone? Look what he does himself! just ask him about his dealings
      with others, how he deceives people! How did he manage to buy this house?
      You may cut off my head if he has not let you in for something&mdash;and
      if he is not trying to cheat you again. You are smiling. You don&rsquo;t believe
      me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me that all this has nothing to do with your affairs,&rdquo;
       remarked the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have lain here now for three days,&rdquo; cried the young man without
      noticing, &ldquo;and I have seen a lot! Fancy! he suspects his daughter, that
      angel, that orphan, my cousin&mdash;he suspects her, and every evening he
      searches her room, to see if she has a lover hidden in it! He comes here
      too on tiptoe, creeping softly&mdash;oh, so softly&mdash;and looks under
      the sofa&mdash;my bed, you know. He is mad with suspicion, and sees a
      thief in every corner. He runs about all night long; he was up at least
      seven times last night, to satisfy himself that the windows and doors were
      barred, and to peep into the oven. That man who appears in court for
      scoundrels, rushes in here in the night and prays, lying prostrate,
      banging his head on the ground by the half-hour&mdash;and for whom do you
      think he prays? Who are the sinners figuring in his drunken petitions? I
      have heard him with my own ears praying for the repose of the soul of the
      Countess du Barry! Colia heard it too. He is as mad as a March hare!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hear how he slanders me, prince,&rdquo; said Lebedeff, almost beside
      himself with rage. &ldquo;I may be a drunkard, an evil-doer, a thief, but at
      least I can say one thing for myself. He does not know&mdash;how should
      he, mocker that he is?&mdash;that when he came into the world it was I who
      washed him, and dressed him in his swathing-bands, for my sister Anisia
      had lost her husband, and was in great poverty. I was very little better
      off than she, but I sat up night after night with her, and nursed both
      mother and child; I used to go downstairs and steal wood for them from the
      house-porter. How often did I sing him to sleep when I was half dead with
      hunger! In short, I was more than a father to him, and now&mdash;now he
      jeers at me! Even if I did cross myself, and pray for the repose of the
      soul of the Comtesse du Barry, what does it matter? Three days ago, for
      the first time in my life, I read her biography in an historical
      dictionary. Do you know who she was? You there!&rdquo; addressing his nephew.
      &ldquo;Speak! do you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course no one knows anything about her but you,&rdquo; muttered the young
      man in a would-be jeering tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was a Countess who rose from shame to reign like a Queen. An Empress
      wrote to her, with her own hand, as &lsquo;<i>Ma chère cousine</i>.&rsquo; At a <i>lever-du-roi</i>
      one morning (do you know what a <i>lever-du-roi</i> was?)&mdash;a
      Cardinal, a Papal legate, offered to put on her stockings; a high and holy
      person like that looked on it as an honour! Did you know this? I see by
      your expression that you did not! Well, how did she die? Answer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! do stop&mdash;you are too absurd!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is how she died. After all this honour and glory, after having been
      almost a Queen, she was guillotined by that butcher, Samson. She was quite
      innocent, but it had to be done, for the satisfaction of the fishwives of
      Paris. She was so terrified, that she did not understand what was
      happening. But when Samson seized her head, and pushed her under the knife
      with his foot, she cried out: &lsquo;Wait a moment! wait a moment, monsieur!&rsquo;
      Well, because of that moment of bitter suffering, perhaps the Saviour will
      pardon her other faults, for one cannot imagine a greater agony. As I read
      the story my heart bled for her. And what does it matter to you, little
      worm, if I implored the Divine mercy for her, great sinner as she was, as
      I said my evening prayer? I might have done it because I doubted if anyone
      had ever crossed himself for her sake before. It may be that in the other
      world she will rejoice to think that a sinner like herself has cried to
      heaven for the salvation of her soul. Why are you laughing? You believe
      nothing, atheist! And your story was not even correct! If you had listened
      to what I was saying, you would have heard that I did not only pray for
      the Comtesse du Barry. I said, &lsquo;Oh Lord! give rest to the soul of that
      great sinner, the Comtesse du Barry, and to all unhappy ones like her.&rsquo;
      You see that is quite a different thing, for how many sinners there are,
      how many women, who have passed through the trials of this life, are now
      suffering and groaning in purgatory! I prayed for you, too, in spite of
      your insolence and impudence, also for your fellows, as it seems that you
      claim to know how I pray...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! that&rsquo;s enough in all conscience! Pray for whom you choose, and the
      devil take them and you! We have a scholar here; you did not know that,
      prince?&rdquo; he continued, with a sneer. &ldquo;He reads all sorts of books and
      memoirs now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any rate, your uncle has a kind heart,&rdquo; remarked the prince, who
      really had to force himself to speak to the nephew, so much did he dislike
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, now you are going to praise him! He will be set up! He puts his hand
      on his heart, and he is delighted! I never said he was a man without
      heart, but he is a rascal&mdash;that&rsquo;s the pity of it. And then, he is
      addicted to drink, and his mind is unhinged, like that of most people who
      have taken more than is good for them for years. He loves his children&mdash;oh,
      I know that well enough! He respected my aunt, his late wife... and he
      even has a sort of affection for me. He has remembered me in his will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall leave you nothing!&rdquo; exclaimed his uncle angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me, Lebedeff,&rdquo; said the prince in a decided voice, turning his
      back on the young man. &ldquo;I know by experience that when you choose, you can
      be business-like... I have very little time to spare, and if you... By
      the way&mdash;excuse me&mdash;what is your Christian name? I have
      forgotten it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ti-Ti-Timofey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lukianovitch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Everyone in the room began to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is telling lies!&rdquo; cried the nephew. &ldquo;Even now he cannot speak the
      truth. He is not called Timofey Lukianovitch, prince, but Lukian
      Timofeyovitch. Now do tell us why you must needs lie about it? Lukian or
      Timofey, it is all the same to you, and what difference can it make to the
      prince? He tells lies without the least necessity, simply by force of
      habit, I assure you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that true?&rdquo; said the prince impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name really is Lukian Timofeyovitch,&rdquo; acknowledged Lebedeff, lowering
      his eyes, and putting his hand on his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, for God&rsquo;s sake, what made you say the other?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To humble myself,&rdquo; murmured Lebedeff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth do you mean? Oh I if only I knew where Colia was at this
      moment!&rdquo; cried the prince, standing up, as if to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can tell you all about Colia,&rdquo; said the young man
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! no, no!&rdquo; said Lebedeff, hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colia spent the night here, and this morning went after his father, whom
      you let out of prison by paying his debts&mdash;Heaven only knows why!
      Yesterday the general promised to come and lodge here, but he did not
      appear. Most probably he slept at the hotel close by. No doubt Colia is
      there, unless he has gone to Pavlofsk to see the Epanchins. He had a
      little money, and was intending to go there yesterday. He must be either
      at the hotel or at Pavlofsk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Pavlofsk! He is at Pavlofsk, undoubtedly!&rdquo; interrupted Lebedeff....
      &ldquo;But come&mdash;let us go into the garden&mdash;we will have coffee
      there....&rdquo; And Lebedeff seized the prince&rsquo;s arm, and led him from the
      room. They went across the yard, and found themselves in a delightful
      little garden with the trees already in their summer dress of green,
      thanks to the unusually fine weather. Lebedeff invited his guest to sit
      down on a green seat before a table of the same colour fixed in the earth,
      and took a seat facing him. In a few minutes the coffee appeared, and the
      prince did not refuse it. The host kept his eyes fixed on Muishkin, with
      an expression of passionate servility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew nothing about your home before,&rdquo; said the prince absently, as if
      he were thinking of something else.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor orphans,&rdquo; began Lebedeff, his face assuming a mournful air, but he
      stopped short, for the other looked at him inattentively, as if he had
      already forgotten his own remark. They waited a few minutes in silence,
      while Lebedeff sat with his eyes fixed mournfully on the young man&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said the latter, at last rousing himself. &ldquo;Ah! yes! You know why I
      came, Lebedeff. Your letter brought me. Speak! Tell me all about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The clerk, rather confused, tried to say something, hesitated, began to
      speak, and again stopped. The prince looked at him gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I understand, Lukian Timofeyovitch: you were not sure that I
      should come. You did not think I should start at the first word from you,
      and you merely wrote to relieve your conscience. However, you see now that
      I have come, and I have had enough of trickery. Give up serving, or trying
      to serve, two masters. Rogojin has been here these three weeks. Have you
      managed to sell her to him as you did before? Tell me the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He discovered everything, the monster... himself......&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t abuse him; though I dare say you have something to complain of....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He beat me, he thrashed me unmercifully!&rdquo; replied Lebedeff vehemently.
      &ldquo;He set a dog on me in Moscow, a bloodhound, a terrible beast that chased
      me all down the street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to take me for a child, Lebedeff. Tell me, is it a fact that she
      left him while they were in Moscow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is a fact, and this time, let me tell you, on the very eve of
      their marriage! It was a question of minutes when she slipped off to
      Petersburg. She came to me directly she arrived&mdash;&lsquo;Save me, Lukian!
      find me some refuge, and say nothing to the prince!&rsquo; She is afraid of you,
      even more than she is of him, and in that she shows her wisdom!&rdquo; And
      Lebedeff slily put his finger to his brow as he said the last words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now it is you who have brought them together again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellency, how could I, how could I prevent it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will do. I can find out for myself. Only tell me, where is she now?
      At his house? With him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no! Certainly not! &lsquo;I am free,&rsquo; she says; you know how she insists on
      that point. &lsquo;I am entirely free.&rsquo; She repeats it over and over again. She
      is living in Petersburgskaia, with my sister-in-law, as I told you in my
      letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is there at this moment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, unless she has gone to Pavlofsk: the fine weather may have tempted
      her, perhaps, into the country, with Daria Alexeyevna. &lsquo;I am quite free,&rsquo;
      she says. Only yesterday she boasted of her freedom to Nicolai
      Ardalionovitch&mdash;a bad sign,&rdquo; added Lebedeff, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colia goes to see her often, does he not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a strange boy, thoughtless, and inclined to be indiscreet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it long since you saw her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I go to see her every day, every day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you were there yesterday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N-no: I have not been these three last days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a pity you have taken too much wine, Lebedeff I want to ask you
      something... but...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right! all right! I am not drunk,&rdquo; replied the clerk, preparing to
      listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, how was she when you left her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is a woman who is seeking...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seeking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She seems always to be searching about, as if she had lost something. The
      mere idea of her coming marriage disgusts her; she looks on it as an
      insult. She cares as much for <i>him</i> as for a piece of orange-peel&mdash;not
      more. Yet I am much mistaken if she does not look on him with fear and
      trembling. She forbids his name to be mentioned before her, and they only
      meet when unavoidable. He understands, well enough! But it must be gone
      through. She is restless, mocking, deceitful, violent....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deceitful and violent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, violent. I can give you a proof of it. A few days ago she tried to
      pull my hair because I said something that annoyed her. I tried to soothe
      her by reading the Apocalypse aloud.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; exclaimed the prince, thinking he had not heard aright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By reading the Apocalypse. The lady has a restless imagination, he-he!
      She has a liking for conversation on serious subjects, of any kind; in
      fact they please her so much, that it flatters her to discuss them. Now
      for fifteen years at least I have studied the Apocalypse, and she agrees
      with me in thinking that the present is the epoch represented by the third
      horse, the black one whose rider holds a measure in his hand. It seems to
      me that everything is ruled by measure in our century; all men are
      clamouring for their rights; &lsquo;a measure of wheat for a penny, and three
      measures of barley for a penny.&rsquo; But, added to this, men desire freedom of
      mind and body, a pure heart, a healthy life, and all God&rsquo;s good gifts. Now
      by pleading their rights alone, they will never attain all this, so the
      white horse, with his rider Death, comes next, and is followed by Hell. We
      talked about this matter when we met, and it impressed her very much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you believe all this?&rdquo; asked Muishkin, looking curiously at his
      companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I both believe it and explain it. I am but a poor creature, a beggar, an
      atom in the scale of humanity. Who has the least respect for Lebedeff? He
      is a target for all the world, the butt of any fool who chooses to kick
      him. But in interpreting revelation I am the equal of anyone, great as he
      may be! Such is the power of the mind and the spirit. I have made a lordly
      personage tremble, as he sat in his armchair... only by talking to him of
      things concerning the spirit. Two years ago, on Easter Eve, His Excellency
      Nil Alexeyovitch, whose subordinate I was then, wished to hear what I had
      to say, and sent a message by Peter Zakkaritch to ask me to go to his
      private room. &lsquo;They tell me you expound the prophecies relating to
      Antichrist,&rsquo; said he, when we were alone. &lsquo;Is that so?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; I answered
      unhesitatingly, and I began to give some comments on the Apostle&rsquo;s
      allegorical vision. At first he smiled, but when we reached the numerical
      computations and correspondences, he trembled, and turned pale. Then he
      begged me to close the book, and sent me away, promising to put my name on
      the reward list. That took place as I said on the eve of Easter, and eight
      days later his soul returned to God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the truth. One evening after dinner he stumbled as he stepped out
      of his carriage. He fell, and struck his head on the curb, and died
      immediately. He was seventy-three years of age, and had a red face, and
      white hair; he deluged himself with scent, and was always smiling like a
      child. Peter Zakkaritch recalled my interview with him, and said, &lsquo;<i>you
      foretold his death.</i>&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince rose from his seat, and Lebedeff, surprised to see his guest
      preparing to go so soon, remarked: &ldquo;You are not interested?&rdquo; in a
      respectful tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not very well, and my head aches. Doubtless the effect of the
      journey,&rdquo; replied the prince, frowning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should go into the country,&rdquo; said Lebedeff timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince seemed to be considering the suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, I am going into the country myself in three days, with my
      children and belongings. The little one is delicate; she needs change of
      air; and during our absence this house will be done up. I am going to
      Pavlofsk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going to Pavlofsk too?&rdquo; asked the prince sharply. &ldquo;Everybody
      seems to be going there. Have you a house in that neighbourhood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know of many people going to Pavlofsk, and as for the house, Ivan
      Ptitsin has let me one of his villas rather cheaply. It is a pleasant
      place, lying on a hill surrounded by trees, and one can live there for a
      mere song. There is good music to be heard, so no wonder it is popular. I
      shall stay in the lodge. As to the villa itself...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you let it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N-no&mdash;not exactly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let it to me,&rdquo; said the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now this was precisely what Lebedeff had made up his mind to do in the
      last three minutes. Not that he had any difficulty in finding a tenant; in
      fact the house was occupied at present by a chance visitor, who had told
      Lebedeff that he would perhaps take it for the summer months. The clerk
      knew very well that this &ldquo;<i>perhaps</i>&rdquo; meant &ldquo;<i>certainly</i>,&rdquo; but as
      he thought he could make more out of a tenant like the prince, he felt
      justified in speaking vaguely about the present inhabitant&rsquo;s intentions.
      &ldquo;This is quite a coincidence,&rdquo; thought he, and when the subject of price
      was mentioned, he made a gesture with his hand, as if to waive away a
      question of so little importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh well, as you like!&rdquo; said Muishkin. &ldquo;I will think it over. You shall
      lose nothing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were walking slowly across the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if you... I could...&rdquo; stammered Lebedeff, &ldquo;if... if you please,
      prince, tell you something on the subject which would interest you, I am
      sure.&rdquo; He spoke in wheedling tones, and wriggled as he walked along.
    </p>
    <p>
      Muishkin stopped short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daria Alexeyevna also has a villa at Pavlofsk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A certain person is very friendly with her, and intends to visit her
      pretty often.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aglaya Ivanovna...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh stop, Lebedeff!&rdquo; interposed Muishkin, feeling as if he had been
      touched on an open wound. &ldquo;That... that has nothing to do with me. I
      should like to know when you are going to start. The sooner the better as
      far as I am concerned, for I am at an hotel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had left the garden now, and were crossing the yard on their way to
      the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, leave your hotel at once and come here; then we can all go together
      to Pavlofsk the day after tomorrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will think about it,&rdquo; said the prince dreamily, and went off.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerk stood looking after his guest, struck by his sudden
      absent-mindedness. He had not even remembered to say goodbye, and Lebedeff
      was the more surprised at the omission, as he knew by experience how
      courteous the prince usually was.
    </p>
    <h3>
      III.
    </h3>
    <p>
      It was now close on twelve o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince knew that if he called at the Epanchins&rsquo; now he would only find
      the general, and that the latter might probably carry him straight off to
      Pavlofsk with him; whereas there was one visit he was most anxious to make
      without delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      So at the risk of missing General Epanchin altogether, and thus postponing
      his visit to Pavlofsk for a day, at least, the prince decided to go and
      look for the house he desired to find.
    </p>
    <p>
      The visit he was about to pay was, in some respects, a risky one. He was
      in two minds about it, but knowing that the house was in the Gorohovaya,
      not far from the Sadovaya, he determined to go in that direction, and to
      try to make up his mind on the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived at the point where the Gorohovaya crosses the Sadovaya, he was
      surprised to find how excessively agitated he was. He had no idea that his
      heart could beat so painfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      One house in the Gorohovaya began to attract his attention long before he
      reached it, and the prince remembered afterwards that he had said to
      himself: &ldquo;That is the house, I&rsquo;m sure of it.&rdquo; He came up to it quite
      curious to discover whether he had guessed right, and felt that he would
      be disagreeably impressed to find that he had actually done so. The house
      was a large gloomy-looking structure, without the slightest claim to
      architectural beauty, in colour a dirty green. There are a few of these
      old houses, built towards the end of the last century, still standing in
      that part of St. Petersburg, and showing little change from their original
      form and colour. They are solidly built, and are remarkable for the
      thickness of their walls, and for the fewness of their windows, many of
      which are covered by gratings. On the ground-floor there is usually a
      money-changer&rsquo;s shop, and the owner lives over it. Without as well as
      within, the houses seem inhospitable and mysterious&mdash;an impression
      which is difficult to explain, unless it has something to do with the
      actual architectural style. These houses are almost exclusively inhabited
      by the merchant class.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived at the gate, the prince looked up at the legend over it, which
      ran:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;House of Rogojin, hereditary and honourable citizen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated no longer; but opened the glazed door at the bottom of the
      outer stairs and made his way up to the second storey. The place was dark
      and gloomy-looking; the walls of the stone staircase were painted a dull
      red. Rogojin and his mother and brother occupied the whole of the second
      floor. The servant who opened the door to Muishkin led him, without taking
      his name, through several rooms and up and down many steps until they
      arrived at a door, where he knocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parfen Rogojin opened the door himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      On seeing the prince he became deadly white, and apparently fixed to the
      ground, so that he was more like a marble statue than a human being. The
      prince had expected some surprise, but Rogojin evidently considered his
      visit an impossible and miraculous event. He stared with an expression
      almost of terror, and his lips twisted into a bewildered smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Parfen! perhaps my visit is ill-timed. I&mdash;I can go away again if you
      like,&rdquo; said Muishkin at last, rather embarrassed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; it&rsquo;s all right, come in,&rdquo; said Parfen, recollecting himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were evidently on quite familiar terms. In Moscow they had had many
      occasions of meeting; indeed, some few of those meetings were but too
      vividly impressed upon their memories. They had not met now, however, for
      three months.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deathlike pallor, and a sort of slight convulsion about the lips, had
      not left Rogojin&rsquo;s face. Though he welcomed his guest, he was still
      obviously much disturbed. As he invited the prince to sit down near the
      table, the latter happened to turn towards him, and was startled by the
      strange expression on his face. A painful recollection flashed into his
      mind. He stood for a time, looking straight at Rogojin, whose eyes seemed
      to blaze like fire. At last Rogojin smiled, though he still looked
      agitated and shaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you staring at me like that for?&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Sit down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince took a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Parfen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;tell me honestly, did you know that I was coming to
      Petersburg or no?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I supposed you were coming,&rdquo; the other replied, smiling
      sarcastically, &ldquo;and I was right in my supposition, you see; but how was I
      to know that you would come <i>today?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A certain strangeness and impatience in his manner impressed the prince
      very forcibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if you had known that I was coming today, why be so irritated about
      it?&rdquo; he asked, in quiet surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you ask me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because when I jumped out of the train this morning, two eyes glared at
      me just as yours did a moment since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! and whose eyes may they have been?&rdquo; said Rogojin, suspiciously. It
      seemed to the prince that he was trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; I thought it was a hallucination. I often have
      hallucinations nowadays. I feel just as I did five years ago when my fits
      were about to come on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, perhaps it was a hallucination, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Parfen.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried to give the prince an affectionate smile, and it seemed to the
      latter as though in this smile of his something had broken, and that he
      could not mend it, try as he would.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall you go abroad again then?&rdquo; he asked, and suddenly added, &ldquo;Do you
      remember how we came up in the train from Pskoff together? You and your
      cloak and leggings, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Rogojin burst out laughing, this time with unconcealed malice, as
      though he were glad that he had been able to find an opportunity for
      giving vent to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you quite taken up your quarters here?&rdquo; asked the prince
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m at home. Where else should I go to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t met for some time. Meanwhile I have heard things about you
      which I should not have believed to be possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What of that? People will say anything,&rdquo; said Rogojin drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At all events, you&rsquo;ve disbanded your troop&mdash;and you are living in
      your own house instead of being fast and loose about the place; that&rsquo;s all
      very good. Is this house all yours, or joint property?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my mother&rsquo;s. You get to her apartments by that passage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your brother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the other wing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Widower. Why do you want to know all this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince looked at him, but said nothing. He had suddenly relapsed into
      musing, and had probably not heard the question at all. Rogojin did not
      insist upon an answer, and there was silence for a few moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guessed which was your house from a hundred yards off,&rdquo; said the prince
      at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite know. Your house has the aspect of yourself and all your
      family; it bears the stamp of the Rogojin life; but ask me why I think so,
      and I can tell you nothing. It is nonsense, of course. I am nervous about
      this kind of thing troubling me so much. I had never before imagined what
      sort of a house you would live in, and yet no sooner did I set eyes on
      this one than I said to myself that it must be yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really!&rdquo; said Rogojin vaguely, not taking in what the prince meant by his
      rather obscure remarks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room they were now sitting in was a large one, lofty but dark, well
      furnished, principally with writing-tables and desks covered with papers
      and books. A wide sofa covered with red morocco evidently served Rogojin
      for a bed. On the table beside which the prince had been invited to seat
      himself lay some books; one containing a marker where the reader had left
      off, was a volume of Solovieff&rsquo;s History. Some oil-paintings in worn
      gilded frames hung on the walls, but it was impossible to make out what
      subjects they represented, so blackened were they by smoke and age. One, a
      life-sized portrait, attracted the prince&rsquo;s attention. It showed a man of
      about fifty, wearing a long riding-coat of German cut. He had two medals
      on his breast; his beard was white, short and thin; his face yellow and
      wrinkled, with a sly, suspicious expression in the eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is your father, is it not?&rdquo; asked the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is,&rdquo; replied Rogojin with an unpleasant smile, as if he had
      expected his guest to ask the question, and then to make some disagreeable
      remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was he one of the Old Believers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he went to church, but to tell the truth he really preferred the old
      religion. This was his study and is now mine. Why did you ask if he were
      an Old Believer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to be married here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye-yes!&rdquo; replied Rogojin, starting at the unexpected question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Soon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know yourself it does not depend on me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Parfen, I am not your enemy, and I do not intend to oppose your
      intentions in any way. I repeat this to you now just as I said it to you
      once before on a very similar occasion. When you were arranging for your
      projected marriage in Moscow, I did not interfere with you&mdash;you know
      I did not. That first time she fled to me from you, from the very altar
      almost, and begged me to &lsquo;save her from you.&rsquo; Afterwards she ran away from
      me again, and you found her and arranged your marriage with her once more;
      and now, I hear, she has run away from you and come to Petersburg. Is it
      true? Lebedeff wrote me to this effect, and that&rsquo;s why I came here. That
      you had once more arranged matters with Nastasia Philipovna I only learned
      last night in the train from a friend of yours, Zaleshoff&mdash;if you
      wish to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I confess I came here with an object. I wished to persuade Nastasia to go
      abroad for her health; she requires it. Both mind and body need a change
      badly. I did not intend to take her abroad myself. I was going to arrange
      for her to go without me. Now I tell you honestly, Parfen, if it is true
      that all is made up between you, I will not so much as set eyes upon her,
      and I will never even come to see you again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know quite well that I am telling the truth, because I have always
      been frank with you. I have never concealed my own opinion from you. I
      have always told you that I consider a marriage between you and her would
      be ruin to her. You would also be ruined, and perhaps even more
      hopelessly. If this marriage were to be broken off again, I admit I should
      be greatly pleased; but at the same time I have not the slightest
      intention of trying to part you. You may be quite easy in your mind, and
      you need not suspect me. You know yourself whether I was ever really your
      rival or not, even when she ran away and came to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, you are laughing at me&mdash;I know why you laugh. It is perfectly
      true that we lived apart from one another all the time, in different
      towns. I told you before that I did not love her with love, but with pity!
      You said then that you understood me; did you really understand me or not?
      What hatred there is in your eyes at this moment! I came to relieve your
      mind, because you are dear to me also. I love you very much, Parfen; and
      now I shall go away and never come back again. Goodbye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay a little,&rdquo; said Parfen, not leaving his chair and resting his head
      on his right hand. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen you for a long time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince sat down again. Both were silent for a few moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you are not with me I hate you, Lef Nicolaievitch. I have loathed
      you every day of these three months since I last saw you. By heaven I
      have!&rdquo; said Rogojin. &ldquo;I could have poisoned you at any minute. Now, you
      have been with me but a quarter of an hour, and all my malice seems to
      have melted away, and you are as dear to me as ever. Stay here a little
      longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I am with you you trust me; but as soon as my back is turned you
      suspect me,&rdquo; said the prince, smiling, and trying to hide his emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trust your voice, when I hear you speak. I quite understand that you
      and I cannot be put on a level, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you add that?&mdash;There! Now you are cross again,&rdquo; said the
      prince, wondering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were not asked, you see. We were made different, with different tastes
      and feelings, without being consulted. You say you love her with pity. I
      have no pity for her. She hates me&mdash;that&rsquo;s the plain truth of the
      matter. I dream of her every night, and always that she is laughing at me
      with another man. And so she does laugh at me. She thinks no more of
      marrying me than if she were changing her shoe. Would you believe it, I
      haven&rsquo;t seen her for five days, and I daren&rsquo;t go near her. She asks me
      what I come for, as if she were not content with having disgraced me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Disgraced you! How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as though you didn&rsquo;t know! Why, she ran away from me, and went to
      you. You admitted it yourself, just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But surely you do not believe that she...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That she did not disgrace me at Moscow with that officer, Zemtuznikoff? I
      know for certain she did, after having fixed our marriage-day herself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; cried the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it for a fact,&rdquo; replied Rogojin, with conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not like her, you say? My friend, that&rsquo;s absurd. Perhaps such an
      act would horrify her, if she were with you, but it is quite different
      where I am concerned. She looks on me as vermin. Her affair with Keller
      was simply to make a laughing-stock of me. You don&rsquo;t know what a fool she
      made of me in Moscow; and the money I spent over her! The money! the
      money!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you can marry her now, Parfen! What will come of it all?&rdquo; said the
      prince, with dread in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rogojin gazed back gloomily, and with a terrible expression in his eyes,
      but said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been to see her for five days,&rdquo; he repeated, after a slight
      pause. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid of being turned out. She says she&rsquo;s still her own
      mistress, and may turn me off altogether, and go abroad. She told me this
      herself,&rdquo; he said, with a peculiar glance at Muishkin. &ldquo;I think she often
      does it merely to frighten me. She is always laughing at me, for some
      reason or other; but at other times she&rsquo;s angry, and won&rsquo;t say a word, and
      that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m afraid of. I took her a shawl one day, the like of which
      she might never have seen, although she did live in luxury and she gave it
      away to her maid, Katia. Sometimes when I can keep away no longer, I steal
      past the house on the sly, and once I watched at the gate till dawn&mdash;I
      thought something was going on&mdash;and she saw me from the window. She
      asked me what I should do if I found she had deceived me. I said, &lsquo;You
      know well enough.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did she know?&rdquo; cried the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How was I to tell?&rdquo; replied Rogojin, with an angry laugh. &ldquo;I did my best
      to catch her tripping in Moscow, but did not succeed. However, I caught
      hold of her one day, and said: &lsquo;You are engaged to be married into a
      respectable family, and do you know what sort of a woman you are? <i>That&rsquo;s</i>
      the sort of woman you are,&rsquo; I said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You told her that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She said, &lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t even have you for a footman now, much less for a
      husband.&rsquo; &lsquo;I shan&rsquo;t leave the house,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;so it doesn&rsquo;t matter.&rsquo;
      &lsquo;Then I shall call somebody and have you kicked out,&rsquo; she cried. So then I
      rushed at her, and beat her till she was bruised all over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; cried the prince, aghast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you it&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said Rogojin quietly, but with eyes ablaze with
      passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then for a day and a half I neither slept, nor ate, nor drank, and would
      not leave her. I knelt at her feet: &lsquo;I shall die here,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;if you
      don&rsquo;t forgive me; and if you have me turned out, I shall drown myself;
      because, what should I be without you now?&rsquo; She was like a madwoman all
      that day; now she would cry; now she would threaten me with a knife; now
      she would abuse me. She called in Zaleshoff and Keller, and showed me to
      them, shamed me in their presence. &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s all go to the theatre,&rsquo; she
      says, &lsquo;and leave him here if he won&rsquo;t go&mdash;it&rsquo;s not my business.
      They&rsquo;ll give you some tea, Parfen Semeonovitch, while I am away, for you
      must be hungry.&rsquo; She came back from the theatre alone. &lsquo;Those cowards
      wouldn&rsquo;t come,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;They are afraid of you, and tried to frighten
      me, too. &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t go away as he came,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll cut your throat&mdash;see
      if he doesn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Now, I shall go to my bedroom, and I shall not even lock
      my door, just to show you how much I am afraid of you. You must be shown
      that once for all. Did you have tea?&rsquo; &lsquo;No,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;and I don&rsquo;t intend
      to.&rsquo; &lsquo;Ha, ha! you are playing off your pride against your stomach! That
      sort of heroism doesn&rsquo;t sit well on you,&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With that she did as she had said she would; she went to bed, and did not
      lock her door. In the morning she came out. &lsquo;Are you quite mad?&rsquo; she said,
      sharply. &lsquo;Why, you&rsquo;ll die of hunger like this.&rsquo; &lsquo;Forgive me,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;No,
      I won&rsquo;t, and I won&rsquo;t marry you. I&rsquo;ve said it. Surely you haven&rsquo;t sat in
      this chair all night without sleeping?&rsquo; &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t sleep,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;H&rsquo;m!
      how sensible of you. And are you going to have no breakfast or dinner
      today?&rsquo; &lsquo;I told you I wouldn&rsquo;t. Forgive me!&rsquo; &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve no idea how
      unbecoming this sort of thing is to you,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s like putting a
      saddle on a cow&rsquo;s back. Do you think you are frightening me? My word, what
      a dreadful thing that you should sit here and eat no food! How terribly
      frightened I am!&rsquo; She wasn&rsquo;t angry long, and didn&rsquo;t seem to remember my
      offence at all. I was surprised, for she is a vindictive, resentful woman&mdash;but
      then I thought that perhaps she despised me too much to feel any
      resentment against me. And that&rsquo;s the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She came up to me and said, &lsquo;Do you know who the Pope of Rome is?&rsquo; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve
      heard of him,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ve read the Universal History,
      Parfen Semeonovitch, haven&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; she asked. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve learned nothing at
      all,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;Then I&rsquo;ll lend it to you to read. You must know there was a
      Roman Pope once, and he was very angry with a certain Emperor; so the
      Emperor came and neither ate nor drank, but knelt before the Pope&rsquo;s palace
      till he should be forgiven. And what sort of vows do you think that
      Emperor was making during all those days on his knees? Stop, I&rsquo;ll read it
      to you!&rsquo; Then she read me a lot of verses, where it said that the Emperor
      spent all the time vowing vengeance against the Pope. &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to
      say you don&rsquo;t approve of the poem, Parfen Semeonovitch,&rsquo; she says. &lsquo;All
      you have read out is perfectly true,&rsquo; say I. &lsquo;Aha!&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;you admit
      it&rsquo;s true, do you? And you are making vows to yourself that if I marry
      you, you will remind me of all this, and take it out of me.&rsquo; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t
      know,&rsquo; I say, &lsquo;perhaps I was thinking like that, and perhaps I was not.
      I&rsquo;m not thinking of anything just now.&rsquo; &lsquo;What are your thoughts, then?&rsquo;
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m thinking that when you rise from your chair and go past me, I watch
      you, and follow you with my eyes; if your dress does but rustle, my heart
      sinks; if you leave the room, I remember every little word and action, and
      what your voice sounded like, and what you said. I thought of nothing all
      last night, but sat here listening to your sleeping breath, and heard you
      move a little, twice.&rsquo; &lsquo;And as for your attack upon me,&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;I
      suppose you never once thought of <i>that?</i>&rsquo; &lsquo;Perhaps I did think of
      it, and perhaps not,&rsquo; I say. &lsquo;And what if I don&rsquo;t either forgive you or
      marry, you?&rsquo; &lsquo;I tell you I shall go and drown myself.&rsquo; &lsquo;H&rsquo;m!&rsquo;
      she said, and  then relapsed into silence. Then she got angry, and went out. &lsquo;I suppose
      you&rsquo;d murder me before you drowned yourself, though!&rsquo; she cried as she
      left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An hour later, she came to me again, looking melancholy. &lsquo;I will marry
      you, Parfen Semeonovitch,&rsquo; she says, not because I&rsquo;m frightened of you,
      but because it&rsquo;s all the same to me how I ruin myself. And how can I do it
      better? Sit down; they&rsquo;ll bring you some dinner directly. And if I do
      marry you, I&rsquo;ll be a faithful wife to you&mdash;you need not doubt that.&rsquo;
      Then she thought a bit, and said, &lsquo;At all events, you are not a flunkey;
      at first, I thought you were no better than a flunkey.&rsquo; And she arranged
      the wedding and fixed the day straight away on the spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, in another week, she had run away again, and came here to
      Lebedeff&rsquo;s; and when I found her here, she said to me, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not going to
      renounce you altogether, but I wish to put off the wedding a bit longer
      yet&mdash;just as long as I like&mdash;for I am still my own mistress; so
      you may wait, if you like.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s how the matter stands between us now.
      What do you think of all this, Lef Nicolaievitch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;What do you think of it yourself?&rdquo; replied the prince, looking sadly at
      Rogojin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As if I can think anything about it! I&mdash;&rdquo; He was about to say more,
      but stopped in despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince rose again, as if he would leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At all events, I shall not interfere with you!&rdquo; he murmured, as though
      making answer to some secret thought of his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what!&rdquo; cried Rogojin, and his eyes flashed fire. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
      understand your yielding her to me like this; I don&rsquo;t understand it. Have
      you given up loving her altogether? At first you suffered badly&mdash;I
      know it&mdash;I saw it. Besides, why did you come post-haste after us? Out
      of pity, eh? He, he, he!&rdquo; His mouth curved in a mocking smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I am deceiving you?&rdquo; asked the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! I trust you&mdash;but I can&rsquo;t understand. It seems to me that your
      pity is greater than my love.&rdquo; A hungry longing to speak his mind out
      seemed to flash in the man&rsquo;s eyes, combined with an intense anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your love is mingled with hatred, and therefore, when your love passes,
      there will be the greater misery,&rdquo; said the prince. &ldquo;I tell you this,
      Parfen&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! that I&rsquo;ll cut her throat, you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll hate her afterwards for all your present love, and for all the
      torment you are suffering on her account now. What seems to me the most
      extraordinary thing is, that she can again consent to marry you, after all
      that has passed between you. When I heard the news yesterday, I could
      hardly bring myself to believe it. Why, she has run twice from you, from
      the very altar rails, as it were. She must have some presentiment of evil.
      What can she want with you now? Your money? Nonsense! Besides, I should
      think you must have made a fairly large hole in your fortune already.
      Surely it is not because she is so very anxious to find a husband? She
      could find many a one besides yourself. Anyone would be better than you,
      because you will murder her, and I feel sure she must know that but too
      well by now. Is it because you love her so passionately? Indeed, that may
      be it. I have heard that there are women who want just that kind of
      love... but still...&rdquo; The prince paused, reflectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you grinning at my father&rsquo;s portrait again for?&rdquo; asked Rogojin,
      suddenly. He was carefully observing every change in the expression of the
      prince&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I smiled because the idea came into my head that if it were not for this
      unhappy passion of yours you might have, and would have, become just such
      a man as your father, and that very quickly, too. You&rsquo;d have settled down
      in this house of yours with some silent and obedient wife. You would have
      spoken rarely, trusted no one, heeded no one, and thought of nothing but
      making money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laugh away! She said exactly the same, almost word for word, when she saw
      my father&rsquo;s portrait. It&rsquo;s remarkable how entirely you and she are at one
      now-a-days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, has she been here?&rdquo; asked the prince with curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! She looked long at the portrait and asked all about my father.
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;d be just such another,&rsquo; she said at last, and laughed. &lsquo;You have
      such strong passions, Parfen,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;that they&rsquo;d have taken you to
      Siberia in no time if you had not, luckily, intelligence as well. For you
      have a good deal of intelligence.&rsquo; (She said this&mdash;believe it or not.
      The first time I ever heard anything of that sort from her.) &lsquo;You&rsquo;d soon
      have thrown up all this rowdyism that you indulge in now, and you&rsquo;d have
      settled down to quiet, steady money-making, because you have little
      education; and here you&rsquo;d have stayed just like your father before you.
      And you&rsquo;d have loved your money so that you&rsquo;d amass not two million, like
      him, but ten million; and you&rsquo;d have died of hunger on your money bags to
      finish up with, for you carry everything to extremes.&rsquo; There, that&rsquo;s
      exactly word for word as she said it to me. She never talked to me like
      that before. She always talks nonsense and laughs when she&rsquo;s with me. We
      went all over this old house together. &lsquo;I shall change all this,&rsquo; I said,
      &lsquo;or else I&rsquo;ll buy a new house for the wedding.&rsquo; &lsquo;No, no!&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t
      touch anything; leave it all as it is; I shall live with your mother when
      I marry you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I took her to see my mother, and she was as respectful and kind as though
      she were her own daughter. Mother has been almost demented ever since
      father died&mdash;she&rsquo;s an old woman. She sits and bows from her chair to
      everyone she sees. If you left her alone and didn&rsquo;t feed her for three
      days, I don&rsquo;t believe she would notice it. Well, I took her hand, and I
      said, &lsquo;Give your blessing to this lady, mother, she&rsquo;s going to be my
      wife.&rsquo; So Nastasia kissed mother&rsquo;s hand with great feeling. &lsquo;She must have
      suffered terribly, hasn&rsquo;t she?&rsquo; she said. She saw this book here lying
      before me. &lsquo;What! have you begun to read Russian history?&rsquo; she asked. She
      told me once in Moscow, you know, that I had better get Solovieff&rsquo;s
      Russian History and read it, because I knew nothing. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s good,&rsquo; she
      said, &lsquo;you go on like that, reading books. I&rsquo;ll make you a list myself of
      the books you ought to read first&mdash;shall I?&rsquo; She had never once
      spoken to me like this before; it was the first time I felt I could
      breathe before her like a living creature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very, very glad to hear of this, Parfen,&rdquo; said the prince, with real
      feeling. &ldquo;Who knows? Maybe God will yet bring you near to one another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, never!&rdquo; cried Rogojin, excitedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Parfen; if you love her so much, surely you must be anxious to
      earn her respect? And if you do so wish, surely you may hope to? I said
      just now that I considered it extraordinary that she could still be ready
      to marry you. Well, though I cannot yet understand it, I feel sure she
      must have some good reason, or she wouldn&rsquo;t do it. She is sure of your
      love; but besides that, she must attribute <i>something</i> else to you&mdash;some
      good qualities, otherwise the thing would not be. What you have just said
      confirms my words. You say yourself that she found it possible to speak to
      you quite differently from her usual manner. You are suspicious, you know,
      and jealous, therefore when anything annoying happens to you, you
      exaggerate its significance. Of course, of course, she does not think so
      ill of you as you say. Why, if she did, she would simply be walking to
      death by drowning or by the knife, with her eyes wide open, when she
      married you. It is impossible! As if anybody would go to their death
      deliberately!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rogojin listened to the prince&rsquo;s excited words with a bitter smile. His
      conviction was, apparently, unalterable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How dreadfully you look at me, Parfen!&rdquo; said the prince, with a feeling
      of dread.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Water or the knife?&rdquo; said the latter, at last. &ldquo;Ha, ha&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      exactly why she is going to marry me, because she knows for certain that
      the knife awaits her. Prince, can it be that you don&rsquo;t even yet see what&rsquo;s
      at the root of it all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he really doesn&rsquo;t understand me! They do say that you are a&mdash;you
      know what! She loves another&mdash;there, you can understand that much!
      Just as I love her, exactly so she loves another man. And that other man
      is&mdash;do you know who? It&rsquo;s you. There&mdash;you didn&rsquo;t know that, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, you! She has loved you ever since that day, her birthday! Only she
      thinks she cannot marry you, because it would be the ruin of you.
      &lsquo;Everybody knows what sort of a woman I am,&rsquo; she says. She told me all
      this herself, to my very face! She&rsquo;s afraid of disgracing and ruining you,
      she says, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter about me. She can marry me all right!
      Notice how much consideration she shows for me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why did she run away to me, and then again from me to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From you to me? Ha, ha! that&rsquo;s nothing! Why, she always acts as though
      she were in a delirium now-a-days! Either she says, &lsquo;Come on, I&rsquo;ll marry
      you! Let&rsquo;s have the wedding quickly!&rsquo; and fixes the day, and seems in a
      hurry for it, and when it begins to come near she feels frightened; or
      else some other idea gets into her head&mdash;goodness knows! you&rsquo;ve seen
      her&mdash;you know how she goes on&mdash;laughing and crying and raving!
      There&rsquo;s nothing extraordinary about her having run away from you! She ran
      away because she found out how dearly she loved you. She could not bear to
      be near you. You said just now that I had found her at Moscow, when she
      ran away from you. I didn&rsquo;t do anything of the sort; she came to me
      herself, straight from you. &lsquo;Name the day&mdash;I&rsquo;m ready!&rsquo; she said.
      &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s have some champagne, and go and hear the gipsies sing!&rsquo; I tell you
      she&rsquo;d have thrown herself into the water long ago if it were not for me!
      She doesn&rsquo;t do it because I am, perhaps, even more dreadful to her than
      the water! She&rsquo;s marrying me out of spite; if she marries me, I tell you,
      it will be for spite!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how do you, how can you&mdash;&rdquo; began the prince, gazing with dread
      and horror at Rogojin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you finish your sentence? Shall I tell you what you were
      thinking to yourself just then? You were thinking, &lsquo;How can she marry him
      after this? How can it possibly be permitted?&rsquo; Oh, I know what you were
      thinking about!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t come here for that purpose, Parfen. That was not in my mind&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may be! Perhaps you didn&rsquo;t <i>come</i> with the idea, but the idea
      is certainly there <i>now!</i> Ha, ha! well, that&rsquo;s enough! What are you
      upset about? Didn&rsquo;t you really know it all before? You astonish me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All this is mere jealousy&mdash;it is some malady of yours, Parfen! You
      exaggerate everything,&rdquo; said the prince, excessively agitated. &ldquo;What are
      you doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let go of it!&rdquo; said Parfen, seizing from the prince&rsquo;s hand a knife which
      the latter had at that moment taken up from the table, where it lay beside
      the history. Parfen replaced it where it had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I seemed to know it&mdash;I felt it, when I was coming back to
      Petersburg,&rdquo; continued the prince, &ldquo;I did not want to come, I wished to
      forget all this, to uproot it from my memory altogether! Well, good-bye&mdash;what
      is the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had absently taken up the knife a second time, and again Rogojin
      snatched it from his hand, and threw it down on the table. It was a plain
      looking knife, with a bone handle, a blade about eight inches long, and
      broad in proportion, it did not clasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing that the prince was considerably struck by the fact that he had
      twice seized this knife out of his hand, Rogojin caught it up with some
      irritation, put it inside the book, and threw the latter across to another
      table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you cut your pages with it, or what?&rdquo; asked Muishkin, still rather
      absently, as though unable to throw off a deep preoccupation into which
      the conversation had thrown him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a garden knife, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Can&rsquo;t one cut pages with a garden knife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite new.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what of that? Can&rsquo;t I buy a new knife if I like?&rdquo; shouted Rogojin
      furiously, his irritation growing with every word.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince shuddered, and gazed fixedly at Parfen. Suddenly he burst out
      laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what an idea!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to ask you any of these
      questions; I was thinking of something quite different! But my head is
      heavy, and I seem so absent-minded nowadays! Well, good-bye&mdash;I can&rsquo;t
      remember what I wanted to say&mdash;good-bye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that way,&rdquo; said Rogojin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, I&rsquo;ve forgotten that too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This way&mdash;come along&mdash;I&rsquo;ll show you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <h3>
      IV.
    </h3>
    <p>
      They passed through the same rooms which the prince had traversed on his
      arrival. In the largest there were pictures on the walls, portraits and
      landscapes of little interest. Over the door, however, there was one of
      strange and rather striking shape; it was six or seven feet in length, and
      not more than a foot in height. It represented the Saviour just taken from
      the cross.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince glanced at it, but took no further notice. He moved on hastily,
      as though anxious to get out of the house. But Rogojin suddenly stopped
      underneath the picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father picked up all these pictures very cheap at auctions, and so
      on,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;they are all rubbish, except the one over the door, and
      that is valuable. A man offered five hundred roubles for it last week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;that&rsquo;s a copy of a Holbein,&rdquo; said the prince, looking at it
      again, &ldquo;and a good copy, too, so far as I am able to judge. I saw the
      picture abroad, and could not forget it&mdash;what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rogojin had dropped the subject of the picture and walked on. Of course
      his strange frame of mind was sufficient to account for his conduct; but,
      still, it seemed queer to the prince that he should so abruptly drop a
      conversation commenced by himself. Rogojin did not take any notice of his
      question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lef Nicolaievitch,&rdquo; said Rogojin, after a pause, during which the two
      walked along a little further, &ldquo;I have long wished to ask you, do you
      believe in God?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How strangely you speak, and how odd you look!&rdquo; said the other,
      involuntarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like looking at that picture,&rdquo; muttered Rogojin, not noticing,
      apparently, that the prince had not answered his question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That picture! That picture!&rdquo; cried Muishkin, struck by a sudden idea.
      &ldquo;Why, a man&rsquo;s faith might be ruined by looking at that picture!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it is!&rdquo; said Rogojin, unexpectedly. They had now reached the front
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What do you mean? I was half joking, and you took me up
      quite seriously! Why do you ask me whether I believe in God?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no particular reason. I meant to ask you before&mdash;many people are
      unbelievers nowadays, especially Russians, I have been told. You ought to
      know&mdash;you&rsquo;ve lived abroad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rogojin laughed bitterly as he said these words, and opening the door,
      held it for the prince to pass out. Muishkin looked surprised, but went
      out. The other followed him as far as the landing of the outer stairs, and
      shut the door behind him. They both now stood facing one another, as
      though oblivious of where they were, or what they had to do next.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, good-bye!&rdquo; said the prince, holding out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; said Rogojin, pressing it hard, but quite mechanically.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince made one step forward, and then turned round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to faith,&rdquo; he said, smiling, and evidently unwilling to leave Rogojin
      in this state&mdash;&ldquo;as to faith, I had four curious conversations in two
      days, a week or so ago. One morning I met a man in the train, and made
      acquaintance with him at once. I had often heard of him as a very learned
      man, but an atheist; and I was very glad of the opportunity of conversing
      with so eminent and clever a person. He doesn&rsquo;t believe in God, and he
      talked a good deal about it, but all the while it appeared to me that he
      was speaking <i>outside the subject</i>. And it has always struck me, both
      in speaking to such men and in reading their books, that they do not seem
      really to be touching on that at all, though on the surface they may
      appear to do so. I told him this, but I dare say I did not clearly express
      what I meant, for he could not understand me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That same evening I stopped at a small provincial hotel, and it so
      happened that a dreadful murder had been committed there the night before,
      and everybody was talking about it. Two peasants&mdash;elderly men and old
      friends&mdash;had had tea together there the night before, and were to
      occupy the same bedroom. They were not drunk but one of them had noticed
      for the first time that his friend possessed a silver watch which he was
      wearing on a chain. He was by no means a thief, and was, as peasants go, a
      rich man; but this watch so fascinated him that he could not restrain
      himself. He took a knife, and when his friend turned his back, he came up
      softly behind, raised his eyes to heaven, crossed himself, and saying
      earnestly&mdash;&lsquo;God forgive me, for Christ&rsquo;s sake!&rsquo; he cut his friend&rsquo;s
      throat like a sheep, and took the watch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rogojin roared with laughter. He laughed as though he were in a sort of
      fit. It was strange to see him laughing so after the sombre mood he had
      been in just before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I like that! That beats anything!&rdquo; he cried convulsively, panting for
      breath. &ldquo;One is an absolute unbeliever; the other is such a thorough-going
      believer that he murders his friend to the tune of a prayer! Oh, prince,
      prince, that&rsquo;s too good for anything! You can&rsquo;t have invented it. It&rsquo;s the
      best thing I&rsquo;ve heard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Next morning I went out for a stroll through the town,&rdquo; continued the
      prince, so soon as Rogojin was a little quieter, though his laughter still
      burst out at intervals, &ldquo;and soon observed a drunken-looking soldier
      staggering about the pavement. He came up to me and said, &lsquo;Buy my silver
      cross, sir! You shall have it for fourpence&mdash;it&rsquo;s real silver.&rsquo; I
      looked, and there he held a cross, just taken off his own neck, evidently,
      a large tin one, made after the Byzantine pattern. I fished out fourpence,
      and put his cross on my own neck, and I could see by his face that he was
      as pleased as he could be at the thought that he had succeeded in cheating
      a foolish gentleman, and away he went to drink the value of his cross. At
      that time everything that I saw made a tremendous impression upon me. I
      had understood nothing about Russia before, and had only vague and
      fantastic memories of it. So I thought, &lsquo;I will wait awhile before I
      condemn this Judas. Only God knows what may be hidden in the hearts of
      drunkards.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I went homewards, and near the hotel I came across a poor woman,
      carrying a child&mdash;a baby of some six weeks old. The mother was quite
      a girl herself. The baby was smiling up at her, for the first time in its
      life, just at that moment; and while I watched the woman she suddenly
      crossed herself, oh, so devoutly! &lsquo;What is it, my good woman?&rsquo; I asked her.
      (I was never but asking questions then!) &lsquo;Exactly as is a mother&rsquo;s joy when
      her baby smiles for the first time into her eyes, so is God&rsquo;s joy when one
      of His children turns and prays to Him for the first time, with all his
      heart!&rsquo; This is what that poor woman said to me, almost word for word; and
      such a deep, refined, truly religious thought it was&mdash;a thought in
      which the whole essence of Christianity was expressed in one flash&mdash;that
      is, the recognition of God as our Father, and of God&rsquo;s joy in men as His
      own children, which is the chief idea of Christ. She was a simple
      country-woman&mdash;a mother, it&rsquo;s true&mdash;and perhaps, who knows, she
      may have been the wife of the drunken soldier!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, Parfen; you put a question to me just now. This is my reply. The
      essence of religious feeling has nothing to do with reason, or atheism, or
      crime, or acts of any kind&mdash;it has nothing to do with these things&mdash;and
      never had. There is something besides all this, something which the
      arguments of the atheists can never touch. But the principal thing, and
      the conclusion of my argument, is that this is most clearly seen in the
      heart of a Russian. This is a conviction which I have gained while I have
      been in this Russia of ours. Yes, Parfen! there is work to be done; there
      is work to be done in this Russian world! Remember what talks we used to
      have in Moscow! And I never wished to come here at all; and I never
      thought to meet you like this, Parfen! Well, well&mdash;good-bye&mdash;good-bye!
      God be with you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned and went downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lef Nicolaievitch!&rdquo; cried Parfen, before he had reached the next landing.
      &ldquo;Have you got that cross you bought from the soldier with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have,&rdquo; and the prince stopped again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show it me, will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A new fancy! The prince reflected, and then mounted the stairs once more.
      He pulled out the cross without taking it off his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give it to me,&rdquo; said Parfen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? do you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince would rather have kept this particular cross.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wear it; and you shall have mine. I&rsquo;ll take it off at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wish to exchange crosses? Very well, Parfen, if that&rsquo;s the case, I&rsquo;m
      glad enough&mdash;that makes us brothers, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince took off his tin cross, Parfen his gold one, and the exchange
      was made.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parfen was silent. With sad surprise the prince observed that the look of
      distrust, the bitter, ironical smile, had still not altogether left his
      newly-adopted brother&rsquo;s face. At moments, at all events, it showed itself
      but too plainly,
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Rogojin took the prince&rsquo;s hand, and stood so for some moments, as
      though he could not make up his mind. Then he drew him along, murmuring
      almost inaudibly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They stopped on the landing, and rang the bell at a door opposite to
      Parfen&rsquo;s own lodging.
    </p>
    <p>
      An old woman opened to them and bowed low to Parfen, who asked her some
      questions hurriedly, but did not wait to hear her answer. He led the
      prince on through several dark, cold-looking rooms, spotlessly clean, with
      white covers over all the furniture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without the ceremony of knocking, Parfen entered a small apartment,
      furnished like a drawing-room, but with a polished mahogany partition
      dividing one half of it from what was probably a bedroom. In one corner of
      this room sat an old woman in an arm-chair, close to the stove. She did
      not look very old, and her face was a pleasant, round one; but she was
      white-haired and, as one could detect at the first glance, quite in her
      second childhood. She wore a black woollen dress, with a black
      handkerchief round her neck and shoulders, and a white cap with black
      ribbons. Her feet were raised on a footstool. Beside her sat another old
      woman, also dressed in mourning, and silently knitting a stocking; this
      was evidently a companion. They both looked as though they never broke the
      silence. The first old woman, so soon as she saw Rogojin and the prince,
      smiled and bowed courteously several times, in token of her gratification
      at their visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; said Rogojin, kissing her hand, &ldquo;here is my great friend, Prince
      Muishkin; we have exchanged crosses; he was like a real brother to me at
      Moscow at one time, and did a great deal for me. Bless him, mother, as you
      would bless your own son. Wait a moment, let me arrange your hands for
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the old lady, before Parfen had time to touch her, raised her right
      hand, and, with three fingers held up, devoutly made the sign of the cross
      three times over the prince. She then nodded her head kindly at him once
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, come along, Lef Nicolaievitch; that&rsquo;s all I brought you here for,&rdquo;
       said Rogojin.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they reached the stairs again he added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She understood nothing of what I said to her, and did not know what I
      wanted her to do, and yet she blessed you; that shows she wished to do so
      herself. Well, goodbye; it&rsquo;s time you went, and I must go too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He opened his own door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let me at least embrace you and say goodbye, you strange fellow!&rdquo;
       cried the prince, looking with gentle reproach at Rogojin, and advancing
      towards him. But the latter had hardly raised his arms when he dropped
      them again. He could not make up his mind to it; he turned away from the
      prince in order to avoid looking at him. He could not embrace him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid,&rdquo; he muttered, indistinctly, &ldquo;though I have taken your
      cross, I shall not murder you for your watch.&rdquo; So saying, he laughed
      suddenly, and strangely. Then in a moment his face became transfigured; he
      grew deadly white, his lips trembled, his eyes burned like fire. He
      stretched out his arms and held the prince tightly to him, and said in a
      strangled voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, take her! It&rsquo;s Fate! She&rsquo;s yours. I surrender her.... Remember
      Rogojin!&rdquo; And pushing the prince from him, without looking back at him, he
      hurriedly entered his own flat, and banged the door.
    </p>
    <h3>
      V.
    </h3>
    <p>
      It was late now, nearly half-past two, and the prince did not find General
      Epanchin at home. He left a card, and determined to look up Colia, who had
      a room at a small hotel near. Colia was not in, but he was informed that
      he might be back shortly, and had left word that if he were not in by
      half-past three it was to be understood that he had gone to Pavlofsk to
      General Epanchin&rsquo;s, and would dine there. The prince decided to wait till
      half-past three, and ordered some dinner. At half-past three there was no
      sign of Colia. The prince waited until four o&rsquo;clock, and then strolled off
      mechanically wherever his feet should carry him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In early summer there are often magnificent days in St. Petersburg&mdash;bright,
      hot and still. This happened to be such a day.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some time the prince wandered about without aim or object. He did not
      know the town well. He stopped to look about him on bridges, at street
      corners. He entered a confectioner&rsquo;s shop to rest, once. He was in a state
      of nervous excitement and perturbation; he noticed nothing and no one; and
      he felt a craving for solitude, to be alone with his thoughts and his
      emotions, and to give himself up to them passively. He loathed the idea of
      trying to answer the questions that would rise up in his heart and mind.
      &ldquo;I am not to blame for all this,&rdquo; he thought to himself, half
      unconsciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards six o&rsquo;clock he found himself at the station of the Tsarsko-Selski
      railway.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was tired of solitude now; a new rush of feeling took hold of him, and
      a flood of light chased away the gloom, for a moment, from his soul. He
      took a ticket to Pavlofsk, and determined to get there as fast as he
      could, but something stopped him; a reality, and not a fantasy, as he was
      inclined to think it. He was about to take his place in a carriage, when
      he suddenly threw away his ticket and came out again, disturbed and
      thoughtful. A few moments later, in the street, he recalled something that
      had bothered him all the afternoon. He caught himself engaged in a strange
      occupation which he now recollected he had taken up at odd moments for the
      last few hours&mdash;it was looking about all around him for something, he
      did not know what. He had forgotten it for a while, half an hour or so,
      and now, suddenly, the uneasy search had recommenced.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he had hardly become conscious of this curious phenomenon, when
      another recollection suddenly swam through his brain, interesting him for
      the moment, exceedingly. He remembered that the last time he had been
      engaged in looking around him for the unknown something, he was standing
      before a cutler&rsquo;s shop, in the window of which were exposed certain goods
      for sale. He was extremely anxious now to discover whether this shop and
      these goods really existed, or whether the whole thing had been a
      hallucination.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt in a very curious condition today, a condition similar to that
      which had preceded his fits in bygone years.
    </p>
    <p>
      He remembered that at such times he had been particularly absentminded,
      and could not discriminate between objects and persons unless he
      concentrated special attention upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He remembered seeing something in the window marked at sixty copecks.
      Therefore, if the shop existed and if this object were really in the
      window, it would prove that he had been able to concentrate his attention
      on this article at a moment when, as a general rule, his absence of mind
      would have been too great to admit of any such concentration; in fact,
      very shortly after he had left the railway station in such a state of
      agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he walked back looking about him for the shop, and his heart beat with
      intolerable impatience. Ah! here was the very shop, and there was the
      article marked &ldquo;60 cop.&rdquo; Of course, it&rsquo;s sixty copecks, he thought, and
      certainly worth no more. This idea amused him and he laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was a hysterical laugh; he was feeling terribly oppressed. He
      remembered clearly that just here, standing before this window, he had
      suddenly turned round, just as earlier in the day he had turned and found
      the dreadful eyes of Rogojin fixed upon him. Convinced, therefore, that in
      this respect at all events he had been under no delusion, he left the shop
      and went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      This must be thought out; it was clear that there had been no
      hallucination at the station then, either; something had actually happened
      to him, on both occasions; there was no doubt of it. But again a loathing
      for all mental exertion overmastered him; he would not think it out now,
      he would put it off and think of something else. He remembered that during
      his epileptic fits, or rather immediately preceding them, he had always
      experienced a moment or two when his whole heart, and mind, and body
      seemed to wake up to vigour and light; when he became filled with joy and
      hope, and all his anxieties seemed to be swept away for ever; these
      moments were but presentiments, as it were, of the one final second (it
      was never more than a second) in which the fit came upon him. That second,
      of course, was inexpressible. When his attack was over, and the prince
      reflected on his symptoms, he used to say to himself: &ldquo;These moments,
      short as they are, when I feel such extreme consciousness of myself, and
      consequently more of life than at other times, are due only to the disease&mdash;to
      the sudden rupture of normal conditions. Therefore they are not really a
      higher kind of life, but a lower.&rdquo; This reasoning, however, seemed to end
      in a paradox, and lead to the further consideration:&mdash;&ldquo;What matter
      though it be only disease, an abnormal tension of the brain, if when I
      recall and analyze the moment, it seems to have been one of harmony and
      beauty in the highest degree&mdash;an instant of deepest sensation,
      overflowing with unbounded joy and rapture, ecstatic devotion, and
      completest life?&rdquo; Vague though this sounds, it was perfectly
      comprehensible to Muishkin, though he knew that it was but a feeble
      expression of his sensations.
    </p>
    <p>
      That there was, indeed, beauty and harmony in those abnormal moments, that
      they really contained the highest synthesis of life, he could not doubt,
      nor even admit the possibility of doubt. He felt that they were not
      analogous to the fantastic and unreal dreams due to intoxication by
      hashish, opium or wine. Of that he could judge, when the attack was over.
      These instants were characterized&mdash;to define it in a word&mdash;by an
      intense quickening of the sense of personality. Since, in the last
      conscious moment preceding the attack, he could say to himself, with full
      understanding of his words: &ldquo;I would give my whole life for this one
      instant,&rdquo; then doubtless to him it really was worth a lifetime. For the
      rest, he thought the dialectical part of his argument of little worth; he
      saw only too clearly that the result of these ecstatic moments was
      stupefaction, mental darkness, idiocy. No argument was possible on that
      point. His conclusion, his estimate of the &ldquo;moment,&rdquo; doubtless contained
      some error, yet the reality of the sensation troubled him. What&rsquo;s more
      unanswerable than a fact? And this fact had occurred. The prince had
      confessed unreservedly to himself that the feeling of intense beatitude in
      that crowded moment made the moment worth a lifetime. &ldquo;I feel then,&rdquo; he
      said one day to Rogojin in Moscow, &ldquo;I feel then as if I understood those
      amazing words&mdash;&lsquo;There shall be no more time.&rsquo;&rdquo; And he added with a
      smile: &ldquo;No doubt the epileptic Mahomet refers to that same moment when he
      says that he visited all the dwellings of Allah, in less time than was
      needed to empty his pitcher of water.&rdquo; Yes, he had often met Rogojin in
      Moscow, and many were the subjects they discussed. &ldquo;He told me I had been
      a brother to him,&rdquo; thought the prince. &ldquo;He said so today, for the first
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was sitting in the Summer Garden on a seat under a tree, and his mind
      dwelt on the matter. It was about seven o&rsquo;clock, and the place was empty.
      The stifling atmosphere foretold a storm, and the prince felt a certain
      charm in the contemplative mood which possessed him. He found pleasure,
      too, in gazing at the exterior objects around him. All the time he was
      trying to forget some thing, to escape from some idea that haunted him;
      but melancholy thoughts came back, though he would so willingly have
      escaped from them. He remembered suddenly how he had been talking to the
      waiter, while he dined, about a recently committed murder which the whole
      town was discussing, and as he thought of it something strange came over
      him. He was seized all at once by a violent desire, almost a temptation,
      against which he strove in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      He jumped up and walked off as fast as he could towards the &ldquo;Petersburg
      Side.&rdquo; [One of the quarters of St. Petersburg.] He had asked someone, a
      little while before, to show him which was the Petersburg Side, on the
      banks of the Neva. He had not gone there, however; and he knew very well
      that it was of no use to go now, for he would certainly not find
      Lebedeff&rsquo;s relation at home. He had the address, but she must certainly
      have gone to Pavlofsk, or Colia would have let him know. If he were to go
      now, it would merely be out of curiosity, but a sudden, new idea had come
      into his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, it was something to move on and know where he was going. A minute
      later he was still moving on, but without knowing anything. He could no
      longer think out his new idea. He tried to take an interest in all he saw;
      in the sky, in the Neva. He spoke to some children he met. He felt his
      epileptic condition becoming more and more developed. The evening was very
      close; thunder was heard some way off.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince was haunted all that day by the face of Lebedeff&rsquo;s nephew whom
      he had seen for the first time that morning, just as one is haunted at
      times by some persistent musical refrain. By a curious association of
      ideas, the young man always appeared as the murderer of whom Lebedeff had
      spoken when introducing him to Muishkin. Yes, he had read something about
      the murder, and that quite recently. Since he came to Russia, he had heard
      many stories of this kind, and was interested in them. His conversation
      with the waiter, an hour ago, chanced to be on the subject of this murder
      of the Zemarins, and the latter had agreed with him about it. He thought
      of the waiter again, and decided that he was no fool, but a steady,
      intelligent man: though, said he to himself, &ldquo;God knows what he may really
      be; in a country with which one is unfamiliar it is difficult to
      understand the people one meets.&rdquo; He was beginning to have a passionate
      faith in the Russian soul, however, and what discoveries he had made in
      the last six months, what unexpected discoveries! But every soul is a
      mystery, and depths of mystery lie in the soul of a Russian. He had been
      intimate with Rogojin, for example, and a brotherly friendship had sprung
      up between them&mdash;yet did he really know him? What chaos and ugliness
      fills the world at times! What a self-satisfied rascal is that nephew of
      Lebedeff&rsquo;s! &ldquo;But what am I thinking,&rdquo; continued the prince to himself.
      &ldquo;Can he really have committed that crime? Did he kill those six persons? I
      seem to be confusing things... how strange it all is.... My head goes
      round... And Lebedeff&rsquo;s daughter&mdash;how sympathetic and charming her
      face was as she held the child in her arms! What an innocent look and
      child-like laugh she had! It is curious that I had forgotten her until
      now. I expect Lebedeff adores her&mdash;and I really believe, when I think
      of it, that as sure as two and two make four, he is fond of that nephew,
      too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well, why should he judge them so hastily! Could he really say what they
      were, after one short visit? Even Lebedeff seemed an enigma today. Did he
      expect to find him so? He had never seen him like that before. Lebedeff
      and the Comtesse du Barry! Good Heavens! If Rogojin should really kill
      someone, it would not, at any rate, be such a senseless, chaotic affair. A
      knife made to a special pattern, and six people killed in a kind of
      delirium. But Rogojin also had a knife made to a special pattern. Can it
      be that Rogojin wishes to murder anyone? The prince began to tremble
      violently. &ldquo;It is a crime on my part to imagine anything so base, with
      such cynical frankness.&rdquo; His face reddened with shame at the thought; and
      then there came across him as in a flash the memory of the incidents at
      the Pavlofsk station, and at the other station in the morning; and the
      question asked him by Rogojin about <i>the eyes</i> and Rogojin&rsquo;s cross,
      that he was even now wearing; and the benediction of Rogojin&rsquo;s mother; and
      his embrace on the darkened staircase&mdash;that last supreme renunciation&mdash;and
      now, to find himself full of this new &ldquo;idea,&rdquo; staring into shop-windows,
      and looking round for things&mdash;how base he was!
    </p>
    <p>
      Despair overmastered his soul; he would not go on, he would go back to his
      hotel; he even turned and went the other way; but a moment after he
      changed his mind again and went on in the old direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, here he was on the Petersburg Side already, quite close to the house!
      Where was his &ldquo;idea&rdquo;? He was marching along without it now. Yes, his
      malady was coming back, it was clear enough; all this gloom and heaviness,
      all these &ldquo;ideas,&rdquo; were nothing more nor less than a fit coming on;
      perhaps he would have a fit this very day.
    </p>
    <p>
      But just now all the gloom and darkness had fled, his heart felt full of
      joy and hope, there was no such thing as doubt. And yes, he hadn&rsquo;t seen
      her for so long; he really must see her. He wished he could meet Rogojin;
      he would take his hand, and they would go to her together. His heart was
      pure, he was no rival of Parfen&rsquo;s. Tomorrow, he would go and tell him that
      he had seen her. Why, he had only come for the sole purpose of seeing her,
      all the way from Moscow! Perhaps she might be here still, who knows? She
      might not have gone away to Pavlofsk yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, all this must be put straight and above-board, there must be no more
      passionate renouncements, such as Rogojin&rsquo;s. It must all be clear as day.
      Cannot Rogojin&rsquo;s soul bear the light? He said he did not love her with
      sympathy and pity; true, he added that &ldquo;your pity is greater than my
      love,&rdquo; but he was not quite fair on himself there. Kin! Rogojin reading a
      book&mdash;wasn&rsquo;t that sympathy beginning? Did it not show that he
      comprehended his relations with her? And his story of waiting day and
      night for her forgiveness? That didn&rsquo;t look quite like passion alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as to her face, could it inspire nothing but passion? Could her face
      inspire passion at all now? Oh, it inspired suffering, grief, overwhelming
      grief of the soul! A poignant, agonizing memory swept over the prince&rsquo;s
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, agonizing. He remembered how he had suffered that first day when he
      thought he observed in her the symptoms of madness. He had almost fallen
      into despair. How could he have lost his hold upon her when she ran away
      from him to Rogojin? He ought to have run after her himself, rather than
      wait for news as he had done. Can Rogojin have failed to observe, up to
      now, that she is mad? Rogojin attributes her strangeness to other causes,
      to passion! What insane jealousy! What was it he had hinted at in that
      suggestion of his? The prince suddenly blushed, and shuddered to his very
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      But why recall all this? There was insanity on both sides. For him, the
      prince, to love this woman with passion, was unthinkable. It would be
      cruel and inhuman. Yes. Rogojin is not fair to himself; he has a large
      heart; he has aptitude for sympathy. When he learns the truth, and finds
      what a pitiable being is this injured, broken, half-insane creature, he
      will forgive her all the torment she has caused him. He will become her
      slave, her brother, her friend. Compassion will teach even Rogojin, it
      will show him how to reason. Compassion is the chief law of human
      existence. Oh, how guilty he felt towards Rogojin! And, for a few warm,
      hasty words spoken in Moscow, Parfen had called him &ldquo;brother,&rdquo; while he&mdash;but
      no, this was delirium! It would all come right! That gloomy Parfen had implied
      that his faith was waning; he must suffer dreadfully. He said he liked to
      look at that picture; it was not that he liked it, but he felt the need of
      looking at it. Rogojin was not merely a passionate soul; he was a fighter.
      He was fighting for the restoration of his dying faith. He must have
      something to hold on to and believe, and someone to believe in. What a
      strange picture that of Holbein&rsquo;s is! Why, this is the street, and here&rsquo;s
      the house, No. 16.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince rang the bell, and asked for Nastasia Philipovna. The lady of
      the house came out, and stated that Nastasia had gone to stay with Daria
      Alexeyevna at Pavlofsk, and might be there some days.

      Madame Filisoff was a little woman of forty, with a cunning face, and
      crafty, piercing eyes. When, with an air of mystery, she asked her
      visitor&rsquo;s name, he refused at first to answer, but in a moment he changed
      his mind, and left strict instructions that it should be given to Nastasia
      Philipovna. The urgency of his request seemed to impress Madame Filisoff,
      and she put on a knowing expression, as if to say, &ldquo;You need not be
      afraid, I quite understand.&rdquo; The prince&rsquo;s name evidently was a great
      surprise to her. He stood and looked absently at her for a moment, then
      turned, and took the road back to his hotel. But he went away not as he
      came. A great change had suddenly come over him. He went blindly forward;
      his knees shook under him; he was tormented by &ldquo;ideas&rdquo;; his lips were
      blue, and trembled with a feeble, meaningless smile. His demon was upon
      him once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      What had happened to him? Why was his brow clammy with drops of moisture,
      his knees shaking beneath him, and his soul oppressed with a cold gloom?
      Was it because he had just seen these dreadful eyes again? Why, he had
      left the Summer Garden on purpose to see them; that had been his &ldquo;idea.&rdquo;
       He had wished to assure himself that he would see them once more at that
      house. Then why was he so overwhelmed now, having seen them as he
      expected? just as though he had not expected to see them! Yes, they were
      the very same eyes; and no doubt about it. The same that he had seen in
      the crowd that morning at the station, the same that he had surprised in
      Rogojin&rsquo;s rooms some hours later, when the latter had replied to his
      inquiry with a sneering laugh, &ldquo;Well, whose eyes were they?&rdquo; Then for the
      third time they had appeared just as he was getting into the train on his
      way to see Aglaya. He had had a strong impulse to rush up to Rogojin, and
      repeat his words of the morning &ldquo;Whose eyes are they?&rdquo; Instead he had fled
      from the station, and knew nothing more, until he found himself gazing
      into the window of a cutler&rsquo;s shop, and wondering if a knife with a
      staghorn handle would cost more than sixty copecks. And as the prince sat
      dreaming in the Summer Garden under a lime-tree, a wicked demon had come
      and whispered in his car: &ldquo;Rogojin has been spying upon you and watching
      you all the morning in a frenzy of desperation. When he finds you have not
      gone to Pavlofsk&mdash;a terrible discovery for him&mdash;he will surely
      go at once to that house in Petersburg Side, and watch for you there,
      although only this morning you gave your word of honour not to see <i>her</i>,
      and swore that you had not come to Petersburg for that purpose.&rdquo; And
      thereupon the prince had hastened off to that house, and what was there in
      the fact that he had met Rogojin there? He had only seen a wretched,
      suffering creature, whose state of mind was gloomy and miserable, but most
      comprehensible. In the morning Rogojin had seemed to be trying to keep out
      of the way; but at the station this afternoon he had stood out, he had
      concealed himself, indeed, less than the prince himself; at the house,
      now, he had stood fifty yards off on the other side of the road, with
      folded hands, watching, plainly in view and apparently desirous of being
      seen. He had stood there like an accuser, like a judge, not like a&mdash;a
      what?
    </p>
    <p>
      And why had not the prince approached him and spoken to him, instead of
      turning away and pretending he had seen nothing, although their eyes met?
      (Yes, their eyes had met, and they had looked at each other.) Why, he had
      himself wished to take Rogojin by the hand and go in together, he had
      himself determined to go to him on the morrow and tell him that he had
      seen her, he had repudiated the demon as he walked to the house, and his
      heart had been full of joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was there something in the whole aspect of the man, today, sufficient to
      justify the prince&rsquo;s terror, and the awful suspicions of his demon?
      Something seen, but indescribable, which filled him with dreadful
      presentiments? Yes, he was convinced of it&mdash;convinced of what? (Oh,
      how mean and hideous of him to feel this conviction, this presentiment!
      How he blamed himself for it!) &ldquo;Speak if you dare, and tell me, what is
      the presentiment?&rdquo; he repeated to himself, over and over again. &ldquo;Put it
      into words, speak out clearly and distinctly. Oh, miserable coward that I
      am!&rdquo; The prince flushed with shame for his own baseness. &ldquo;How shall I ever
      look this man in the face again? My God, what a day! And what a nightmare,
      what a nightmare!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment, during this long, wretched walk back from the
      Petersburg Side, when the prince felt an irresistible desire to go
      straight to Rogojin&rsquo;s, wait for him, embrace him with tears of shame and
      contrition, and tell him of his distrust, and finish with it&mdash;once
      for all.
    </p>
    <p>
      But here he was back at his hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      How often during the day he had thought of this hotel with loathing&mdash;its
      corridor, its rooms, its stairs. How he had dreaded coming back to it, for
      some reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a regular old woman I am today,&rdquo; he had said to himself each time,
      with annoyance. &ldquo;I believe in every foolish presentiment that comes into
      my head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped for a moment at the door; a great flush of shame came over him.
      &ldquo;I am a coward, a wretched coward,&rdquo; he said, and moved forward again; but
      once more he paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among all the incidents of the day, one recurred to his mind to the
      exclusion of the rest; although now that his self-control was regained,
      and he was no longer under the influence of a nightmare, he was able to
      think of it calmly. It concerned the knife on Rogojin&rsquo;s table. &ldquo;Why should
      not Rogojin have as many knives on his table as he chooses?&rdquo; thought the
      prince, wondering at his suspicions, as he had done when he found himself
      looking into the cutler&rsquo;s window. &ldquo;What could it have to do with me?&rdquo; he
      said to himself again, and stopped as if rooted to the ground by a kind of
      paralysis of limb such as attacks people under the stress of some
      humiliating recollection.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doorway was dark and gloomy at any time; but just at this moment it
      was rendered doubly so by the fact that the thunder-storm had just broken,
      and the rain was coming down in torrents.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in the semi-darkness the prince distinguished a man standing close to
      the stairs, apparently waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing particularly significant in the fact that a man was
      standing back in the doorway, waiting to come out or go upstairs; but the
      prince felt an irresistible conviction that he knew this man, and that it
      was Rogojin. The man moved on up the stairs; a moment later the prince
      passed up them, too. His heart froze within him. &ldquo;In a minute or two I
      shall know all,&rdquo; he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      The staircase led to the first and second corridors of the hotel, along
      which lay the guests&rsquo; bedrooms. As is often the case in Petersburg houses,
      it was narrow and very dark, and turned around a massive stone column.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the first landing, which was as small as the necessary turn of the
      stairs allowed, there was a niche in the column, about half a yard wide,
      and in this niche the prince felt convinced that a man stood concealed. He
      thought he could distinguish a figure standing there. He would pass by
      quickly and not look. He took a step forward, but could bear the
      uncertainty no longer and turned his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eyes&mdash;the same two eyes&mdash;met his! The man concealed in the
      niche had also taken a step forward. For one second they stood face to
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the prince caught the man by the shoulder and twisted him round
      towards the light, so that he might see his face more clearly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rogojin&rsquo;s eyes flashed, and a smile of insanity distorted his countenance.
      His right hand was raised, and something glittered in it. The prince did
      not think of trying to stop it. All he could remember afterwards was that
      he seemed to have called out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Parfen! I won&rsquo;t believe it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Next moment something appeared to burst open before him: a wonderful inner
      light illuminated his soul. This lasted perhaps half a second, yet he
      distinctly remembered hearing the beginning of the wail, the strange,
      dreadful wail, which burst from his lips of its own accord, and which no
      effort of will on his part could suppress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next moment he was absolutely unconscious; black darkness blotted out
      everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had fallen in an epileptic fit.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      As is well known, these fits occur instantaneously. The face, especially
      the eyes, become terribly disfigured, convulsions seize the limbs, a
      terrible cry breaks from the sufferer, a wail from which everything human
      seems to be blotted out, so that it is impossible to believe that the man
      who has just fallen is the same who emitted the dreadful cry. It seems
      more as though some other being, inside the stricken one, had cried. Many
      people have borne witness to this impression; and many cannot behold an
      epileptic fit without a feeling of mysterious terror and dread.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a feeling, we must suppose, overtook Rogojin at this moment, and
      saved the prince&rsquo;s life. Not knowing that it was a fit, and seeing his
      victim disappear head foremost into the darkness, hearing his head strike
      the stone steps below with a crash, Rogojin rushed downstairs, skirting
      the body, and flung himself headlong out of the hotel, like a raving
      madman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince&rsquo;s body slipped convulsively down the steps till it rested at
      the bottom. Very soon, in five minutes or so, he was discovered, and a
      crowd collected around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      A pool of blood on the steps near his head gave rise to grave fears. Was
      it a case of accident, or had there been a crime? It was, however, soon
      recognized as a case of epilepsy, and identification and proper measures
      for restoration followed one another, owing to a fortunate circumstance.
      Colia Ivolgin had come back to his hotel about seven o&rsquo;clock, owing to a
      sudden impulse which made him refuse to dine at the Epanchins&rsquo;, and,
      finding a note from the prince awaiting him, had sped away to the latter&rsquo;s
      address. Arrived there, he ordered a cup of tea and sat sipping it in the
      coffee-room. While there he heard excited whispers of someone just found
      at the bottom of the stairs in a fit; upon which he had hurried to the
      spot, with a presentiment of evil, and at once recognized the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sufferer was immediately taken to his room, and though he partially
      regained consciousness, he lay long in a semi-dazed condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor stated that there was no danger to be apprehended from the
      wound on the head, and as soon as the prince could understand what was
      going on around him, Colia hired a carriage and took him away to
      Lebedeff&rsquo;s. There he was received with much cordiality, and the departure
      to the country was hastened on his account. Three days later they were all
      at Pavlofsk.
    </p>
    <h3>
      VI.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Lebedeff&rsquo;s country-house was not large, but it was pretty and convenient,
      especially the part which was let to the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      A row of orange and lemon trees and jasmines, planted in green tubs, stood
      on the fairly wide terrace. According to Lebedeff, these trees gave the
      house a most delightful aspect. Some were there when he bought it, and he
      was so charmed with the effect that he promptly added to their number.
      When the tubs containing these plants arrived at the villa and were set in
      their places, Lebedeff kept running into the street to enjoy the view of
      the house, and every time he did so the rent to be demanded from the
      future tenant went up with a bound.
    </p>
    <p>
      This country villa pleased the prince very much in his state of physical
      and mental exhaustion. On the day that they left for Pavlofsk, that is the
      day after his attack, he appeared almost well, though in reality he felt
      very far from it. The faces of those around him for the last three days
      had made a pleasant impression. He was pleased to see, not only Colia, who
      had become his inseparable companion, but Lebedeff himself and all the
      family, except the nephew, who had left the house. He was also glad to
      receive a visit from General Ivolgin, before leaving St. Petersburg.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was getting late when the party arrived at Pavlofsk, but several people
      called to see the prince, and assembled in the verandah. Gania was the
      first to arrive. He had grown so pale and thin that the prince could
      hardly recognize him. Then came Varia and Ptitsin, who were rusticating in
      the neighbourhood. As to General Ivolgin, he scarcely budged from
      Lebedeff&rsquo;s house, and seemed to have moved to Pavlofsk with him. Lebedeff
      did his best to keep Ardalion Alexandrovitch by him, and to prevent him
      from invading the prince&rsquo;s quarters. He chatted with him confidentially,
      so that they might have been taken for old friends. During those three
      days the prince had noticed that they frequently held long conversations;
      he often heard their voices raised in argument on deep and learned
      subjects, which evidently pleased Lebedeff. He seemed as if he could not
      do without the general. But it was not only Ardalion Alexandrovitch whom
      Lebedeff kept out of the prince&rsquo;s way. Since they had come to the villa,
      he treated his own family the same. Upon the pretext that his tenant
      needed quiet, he kept him almost in isolation, and Muishkin protested in
      vain against this excess of zeal. Lebedeff stamped his feet at his
      daughters and drove them away if they attempted to join the prince on the
      terrace; not even Vera was excepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will lose all respect if they are allowed to be so free and easy;
      besides it is not proper for them,&rdquo; he declared at last, in answer to a
      direct question from the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why on earth not?&rdquo; asked the latter. &ldquo;Really, you know, you are making
      yourself a nuisance, by keeping guard over me like this. I get bored all
      by myself; I have told you so over and over again, and you get on my
      nerves more than ever by waving your hands and creeping in and out in the
      mysterious way you do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a fact that Lebedeff, though he was so anxious to keep everyone
      else from disturbing the patient, was continually in and out of the
      prince&rsquo;s room himself. He invariably began by opening the door a crack and
      peering in to see if the prince was there, or if he had escaped; then he
      would creep softly up to the arm-chair, sometimes making Muishkin jump by
      his sudden appearance. He always asked if the patient wanted anything, and
      when the latter replied that he only wanted to be left in peace, he would
      turn away obediently and make for the door on tip-toe, with deprecatory
      gestures to imply that he had only just looked in, that he would not speak
      a word, and would go away and not intrude again; which did not prevent him
      from reappearing in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour. Colia had free
      access to the prince, at which Lebedeff was quite disgusted and indignant.
      He would listen at the door for half an hour at a time while the two were
      talking. Colia found this out, and naturally told the prince of his
      discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think yourself my master, that you try to keep me under lock and
      key like this?&rdquo; said the prince to Lebedeff. &ldquo;In the country, at least, I
      intend to be free, and you may make up your mind that I mean to see whom I
      like, and go where I please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course,&rdquo; replied the clerk, gesticulating with his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince looked him sternly up and down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Lukian Timofeyovitch, have you brought the little cupboard that you
      had at the head of your bed with you here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I left it where it was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It cannot be moved; you would have to pull the wall down, it is so firmly
      fixed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you have one like it here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have one that is even better, much better; that is really why I bought
      this house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! What visitor did you turn away from my door, about an hour ago?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The-the general. I would not let him in; there is no need for him to
      visit you, prince... I have the deepest esteem for him, he is a&mdash;a
      great man. You don&rsquo;t believe it? Well, you will see, and yet, most
      excellent prince, you had much better not receive him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask why? and also why you walk about on tiptoe and always seem as
      if you were going to whisper a secret in my ear whenever you come near
      me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am vile, vile; I know it!&rdquo; cried Lebedeff, beating his breast with a
      contrite air. &ldquo;But will not the general be too hospitable for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too hospitable?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. First, he proposes to come and live in my house. Well and good; but
      he sticks at nothing; he immediately makes himself one of the family. We
      have talked over our respective relations several times, and discovered
      that we are connected by marriage. It seems also that you are a sort of
      nephew on his mother&rsquo;s side; he was explaining it to me again only
      yesterday. If you are his nephew, it follows that I must also be a
      relation of yours, most excellent prince. Never mind about that, it is
      only a foible; but just now he assured me that all his life, from the day
      he was made an ensign to the 11th of last June, he has entertained at
      least two hundred guests at his table every day. Finally, he went so far
      as to say that they never rose from the table; they dined, supped, and had
      tea, for fifteen hours at a stretch. This went on for thirty years without
      a break; there was barely time to change the table-cloth; directly one
      person left, another took his place. On feast-days he entertained as many
      as three hundred guests, and they numbered seven hundred on the thousandth
      anniversary of the foundation of the Russian Empire. It amounts to a
      passion with him; it makes one uneasy to hear of it. It is terrible to
      have to entertain people who do things on such a scale. That is why I
      wonder whether such a man is not too hospitable for you and me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you seem to be on the best of terms with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite fraternal&mdash;I look upon it as a joke. Let us be
      brothers-in-law, it is all the same to me,&mdash;rather an honour than
      not. But in spite of the two hundred guests and the thousandth anniversary
      of the Russian Empire, I can see that he is a very remarkable man. I am
      quite sincere. You said just now that I always looked as if I was going to
      tell you a secret; you are right. I have a secret to tell you: a certain
      person has just let me know that she is very anxious for a secret
      interview with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should it be secret? Not at all; I will call on her myself tomorrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, oh no!&rdquo; cried Lebedeff, waving his arms; &ldquo;if she is afraid, it is not
      for the reason you think. By the way, do you know that the monster comes
      every day to inquire after your health?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You call him a monster so often that it makes me suspicious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have no suspicions, none whatever,&rdquo; said Lebedeff quickly. &ldquo;I
      only want you to know that the person in question is not afraid of him,
      but of something quite, quite different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth is she afraid of, then? Tell me plainly, without any more
      beating about the bush,&rdquo; said the prince, exasperated by the other&rsquo;s
      mysterious grimaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah that is the secret,&rdquo; said Lebedeff, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whose secret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours. You forbade me yourself to mention it before you, most excellent
      prince,&rdquo; murmured Lebedeff. Then, satisfied that he had worked up
      Muishkin&rsquo;s curiosity to the highest pitch, he added abruptly: &ldquo;She is
      afraid of Aglaya Ivanovna.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince frowned for a moment in silence, and then said suddenly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, Lebedeff, I must leave your house. Where are Gavrila
      Ardalionovitch and the Ptitsins? Are they here? Have you chased them away,
      too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are coming, they are coming; and the general as well. I will open
      all the doors; I will call all my daughters, all of them, this very
      minute,&rdquo; said Lebedeff in a low voice, thoroughly frightened, and waving
      his hands as he ran from door to door.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment Colia appeared on the terrace; he announced that Lizabetha
      Prokofievna and her three daughters were close behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moved by this news, Lebedeff hurried up to the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I call the Ptitsins, and Gavrila Ardalionovitch? Shall I let the
      general in?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? Let in anyone who wants to see me. I assure you, Lebedeff, you
      have misunderstood my position from the very first; you have been wrong
      all along. I have not the slightest reason to hide myself from anyone,&rdquo;
       replied the prince gaily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing him laugh, Lebedeff thought fit to laugh also, and though much
      agitated his satisfaction was quite visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colia was right; the Epanchin ladies were only a few steps behind him. As
      they approached the terrace other visitors appeared from Lebedeff&rsquo;s side
      of the house&mdash;the Ptitsins, Gania, and Ardalion Alexandrovitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Epanchins had only just heard of the prince&rsquo;s illness and of his
      presence in Pavlofsk, from Colia; and up to this time had been in a state
      of considerable bewilderment about him. The general brought the prince&rsquo;s
      card down from town, and Mrs. Epanchin had felt convinced that he himself
      would follow his card at once; she was much excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      In vain the girls assured her that a man who had not written for six
      months would not be in such a dreadful hurry, and that probably he had
      enough to do in town without needing to bustle down to Pavlofsk to see
      them. Their mother was quite angry at the very idea of such a thing, and
      announced her absolute conviction that he would turn up the next day at
      latest.
    </p>
    <p>
      So next day the prince was expected all the morning, and at dinner, tea,
      and supper; and when he did not appear in the evening, Mrs. Epanchin
      quarrelled with everyone in the house, finding plenty of pretexts without
      so much as mentioning the prince&rsquo;s name.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the third day there was no talk of him at all, until Aglaya remarked at
      dinner: &ldquo;Mamma is cross because the prince hasn&rsquo;t turned up,&rdquo; to which the
      general replied that it was not his fault.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Epanchin misunderstood the observation, and rising from her place she
      left the room in majestic wrath. In the evening, however, Colia came with
      the story of the prince&rsquo;s adventures, so far as he knew them. Mrs.
      Epanchin was triumphant; although Colia had to listen to a long lecture.
      &ldquo;He idles about here the whole day long, one can&rsquo;t get rid of him; and
      then when he is wanted he does not come. He might have sent a line if he
      did not wish to inconvenience himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the words &ldquo;one can&rsquo;t get rid of him,&rdquo; Colia was very angry, and nearly
      flew into a rage; but he resolved to be quiet for the time and show his
      resentment later. If the words had been less offensive he might have
      forgiven them, so pleased was he to see Lizabetha Prokofievna worried and
      anxious about the prince&rsquo;s illness.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would have insisted on sending to Petersburg at once, for a certain
      great medical celebrity; but her daughters dissuaded her, though they were
      not willing to stay behind when she at once prepared to go and visit the
      invalid. Aglaya, however, suggested that it was a little unceremonious to
      go <i>en masse</i> to see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well then, stay at home,&rdquo; said Mrs. Epanchin, &ldquo;and a good thing too,
      for Evgenie Pavlovitch is coming down and there will be no one at home to
      receive him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of course, after this, Aglaya went with the rest. In fact, she had never
      had the slightest intention of doing otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prince S., who was in the house, was requested to escort the ladies. He
      had been much interested when he first heard of the prince from the
      Epanchins. It appeared that they had known one another before, and had
      spent some time together in a little provincial town three months ago.
      Prince S. had greatly taken to him, and was delighted with the opportunity
      of meeting him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general had not come down from town as yet, nor had Evgenie Pavlovitch
      arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not more than two or three hundred yards from the Epanchins&rsquo; house
      to Lebedeff&rsquo;s. The first disagreeable impression experienced by Mrs.
      Epanchin was to find the prince surrounded by a whole assembly of other
      guests&mdash;not to mention the fact that some of those present were
      particularly detestable in her eyes. The next annoying circumstance was
      when an apparently strong and healthy young fellow, well dressed, and
      smiling, came forward to meet her on the terrace, instead of the
      half-dying unfortunate whom she had expected to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was astonished and vexed, and her disappointment pleased Colia
      immensely. Of course he could have undeceived her before she started, but
      the mischievous boy had been careful not to do that, foreseeing the
      probably laughable disgust that she would experience when she found her
      dear friend, the prince, in good health. Colia was indelicate enough to
      voice the delight he felt at his success in managing to annoy Lizabetha
      Prokofievna, with whom, in spite of their really amicable relations, he
      was constantly sparring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just wait a while, my boy!&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be too certain of your
      triumph.&rdquo; And she sat down heavily, in the arm-chair pushed forward by the
      prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lebedeff, Ptitsin, and General Ivolgin hastened to find chairs for the
      young ladies. Varia greeted them joyfully, and they exchanged confidences
      in ecstatic whispers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must admit, prince, I was a little put out to see you up and about like
      this&mdash;I expected to find you in bed; but I give you my word, I was
      only annoyed for an instant, before I collected my thoughts properly. I am
      always wiser on second thoughts, and I dare say you are the same. I assure
      you I am as glad to see you well as though you were my own son,&mdash;yes,
      and more; and if you don&rsquo;t believe me the more shame to you, and it&rsquo;s not
      my fault. But that spiteful boy delights in playing all sorts of tricks.
      You are his patron, it seems. Well, I warn you that one fine morning I
      shall deprive myself of the pleasure of his further acquaintance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have I done wrong now?&rdquo; cried Colia. &ldquo;What was the good of telling
      you that the prince was nearly well again? You would not have believed me;
      it was so much more interesting to picture him on his death-bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long do you remain here, prince?&rdquo; asked Madame Epanchin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the summer, and perhaps longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are alone, aren&rsquo;t you,&mdash;not married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not married!&rdquo; replied the prince, smiling at the ingenuousness of
      this little feeler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you needn&rsquo;t laugh! These things do happen, you know! Now then&mdash;why
      didn&rsquo;t you come to us? We have a wing quite empty. But just as you like,
      of course. Do you lease it from <i>him?</i>&mdash;this fellow, I mean,&rdquo;
       she added, nodding towards Lebedeff. &ldquo;And why does he always wriggle so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment Vera, carrying the baby in her arms as usual, came out of
      the house, on to the terrace. Lebedeff kept fidgeting among the chairs,
      and did not seem to know what to do with himself, though he had no
      intention of going away. He no sooner caught sight of his daughter, than
      he rushed in her direction, waving his arms to keep her away; he even
      forgot himself so far as to stamp his foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he mad?&rdquo; asked Madame Epanchin suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he is drunk? Your company is rather peculiar,&rdquo; she added, with a
      glance at the other guests....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what a pretty girl! Who is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is Lebedeff&rsquo;s daughter&mdash;Vera Lukianovna.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed? She looks very sweet. I should like to make her acquaintance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words were hardly out of her mouth, when Lebedeff dragged Vera
      forward, in order to present her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Orphans, poor orphans!&rdquo; he began in a pathetic voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The child she carries is an orphan, too. She is Vera&rsquo;s sister, my
      daughter Luboff. The day this babe was born, six weeks ago, my wife died,
      by the will of God Almighty.... Yes... Vera takes her mother&rsquo;s place,
      though she is but her sister... nothing more... nothing more...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you! You are nothing more than a fool, if you&rsquo;ll excuse me! Well!
      well! you know that yourself, I expect,&rdquo; said the lady indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lebedeff bowed low. &ldquo;It is the truth,&rdquo; he replied, with extreme respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Lebedeff, I am told you lecture on the Apocalypse. Is it true?&rdquo;
       asked Aglaya.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that is so... for the last fifteen years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard of you, and I think read of you in the newspapers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, that was another commentator, whom the papers named. He is dead,
      however, and I have taken his place,&rdquo; said the other, much delighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are neighbours, so will you be so kind as to come over one day and
      explain the Apocalypse to me?&rdquo; said Aglaya. &ldquo;I do not understand it in the
      least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allow me to warn you,&rdquo; interposed General Ivolgin, &ldquo;that he is the
      greatest charlatan on earth.&rdquo; He had taken the chair next to the girl, and
      was impatient to begin talking. &ldquo;No doubt there are pleasures and
      amusements peculiar to the country,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;and to listen to a
      pretended student holding forth on the book of the Revelations may be as
      good as any other. It may even be original. But... you seem to be looking
      at me with some surprise&mdash;may I introduce myself&mdash;General
      Ivolgin&mdash;I carried you in my arms as a baby&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Delighted, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; said Aglaya; &ldquo;I am acquainted with Varvara
      Ardalionovna and Nina Alexandrovna.&rdquo; She was trying hard to restrain
      herself from laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Epanchin flushed up; some accumulation of spleen in her suddenly
      needed an outlet. She could not bear this General Ivolgin whom she had
      once known, long ago&mdash;in society.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are deviating from the truth, sir, as usual!&rdquo; she remarked, boiling
      over with indignation; &ldquo;you never carried her in your life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have forgotten, mother,&rdquo; said Aglaya, suddenly. &ldquo;He really did carry
      me about,&mdash;in Tver, you know. I was six years old, I remember. He
      made me a bow and arrow, and I shot a pigeon. Don&rsquo;t you remember shooting
      a pigeon, you and I, one day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and he made me a cardboard helmet, and a little wooden sword&mdash;I
      remember!&rdquo; said Adelaida.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I remember too!&rdquo; said Alexandra. &ldquo;You quarrelled about the wounded
      pigeon, and Adelaida was put in the corner, and stood there with her
      helmet and sword and all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The poor general had merely made the remark about having carried Aglaya in
      his arms because he always did so begin a conversation with young people.
      But it happened that this time he had really hit upon the truth, though he
      had himself entirely forgotten the fact. But when Adelaida and Aglaya
      recalled the episode of the pigeon, his mind became filled with memories,
      and it is impossible to describe how this poor old man, usually half
      drunk, was moved by the recollection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember&mdash;I remember it all!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I was captain then. You
      were such a lovely little thing&mdash;Nina Alexandrovna!&mdash;Gania,
      listen! I was received then by General Epanchin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and look what you have come to now!&rdquo; interrupted Mrs. Epanchin.
      &ldquo;However, I see you have not quite drunk your better feelings away. But
      you&rsquo;ve broken your wife&rsquo;s heart, sir&mdash;and instead of looking after
      your children, you have spent your time in public-houses and debtors&rsquo;
      prisons! Go away, my friend, stand in some corner and weep, and bemoan
      your fallen dignity, and perhaps God will forgive you yet! Go, go! I&rsquo;m
      serious! There&rsquo;s nothing so favourable for repentance as to think of the
      past with feelings of remorse!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no need to repeat that she was serious. The general, like all
      drunkards, was extremely emotional and easily touched by recollections of
      his better days. He rose and walked quietly to the door, so meekly that
      Mrs. Epanchin was instantly sorry for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ardalion Alexandrovitch,&rdquo; she cried after him, &ldquo;wait a moment, we are all
      sinners! When you feel that your conscience reproaches you a little less,
      come over to me and we&rsquo;ll have a talk about the past! I dare say I am
      fifty times more of a sinner than you are! And now go, go, good-bye, you
      had better not stay here!&rdquo; she added, in alarm, as he turned as though to
      come back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go after him just now, Colia, or he&rsquo;ll be vexed, and the benefit of
      this moment will be lost!&rdquo; said the prince, as the boy was hurrying out of
      the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite true! Much better to go in half an hour or so,&rdquo; said Mrs. Epanchin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what comes of telling the truth for once in one&rsquo;s life!&rdquo; said
      Lebedeff. &ldquo;It reduced him to tears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come! the less <i>you</i> say about it the better&mdash;to judge
      from all I have heard about you!&rdquo; replied Mrs. Epanchin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince took the first opportunity of informing the Epanchin ladies
      that he had intended to pay them a visit that day, if they had not
      themselves come this afternoon, and Lizabetha Prokofievna replied that she
      hoped he would still do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time some of the visitors had disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ptitsin had tactfully retreated to Lebedeff&rsquo;s wing; and Gania soon
      followed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter had behaved modestly, but with dignity, on this occasion of his
      first meeting with the Epanchins since the rupture. Twice Mrs. Epanchin
      had deliberately examined him from head to foot; but he had stood fire
      without flinching. He was certainly much changed, as anyone could see who
      had not met him for some time; and this fact seemed to afford Aglaya a
      good deal of satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was Gavrila Ardalionovitch, who just went out, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she asked
      suddenly, interrupting somebody else&rsquo;s conversation to make the remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it was,&rdquo; said the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hardly knew him; he is much changed, and for the better!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very glad,&rdquo; said the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has been very ill,&rdquo; added Varia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How has he changed for the better?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Epanchin. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see any
      change for the better! What&rsquo;s better in him? Where did you get <i>that</i>
      idea from? <i>what</i>&rsquo;s better?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing better than the &lsquo;poor knight&rsquo;!&rdquo; said Colia, who was
      standing near the last speaker&rsquo;s chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I quite agree with you there!&rdquo; said Prince S., laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; said Adelaida, solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>What</i> poor knight?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Epanchin, looking round at the face
      of each of the speakers in turn. Seeing, however, that Aglaya was
      blushing, she added, angrily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What nonsense you are all talking! What do you mean by poor knight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the first time this urchin, your favourite, has shown his
      impudence by twisting other people&rsquo;s words,&rdquo; said Aglaya, haughtily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every time that Aglaya showed temper (and this was very often), there was
      so much childish pouting, such &ldquo;school-girlishness,&rdquo; as it were, in her
      apparent wrath, that it was impossible to avoid smiling at her, to her own
      unutterable indignation. On these occasions she would say, &ldquo;How can they,
      how <i>dare</i> they laugh at me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This time everyone laughed at her, her sisters, Prince S., Prince Muishkin
      (though he himself had flushed for some reason), and Colia. Aglaya was
      dreadfully indignant, and looked twice as pretty in her wrath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s always twisting round what one says,&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am only repeating your own exclamation!&rdquo; said Colia. &ldquo;A month ago you
      were turning over the pages of your Don Quixote, and suddenly called out
      &lsquo;there is nothing better than the poor knight.&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t know whom you were
      referring to, of course, whether to Don Quixote, or Evgenie Pavlovitch, or
      someone else, but you certainly said these words, and afterwards there was
      a long conversation...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are inclined to go a little too far, my good boy, with your guesses,&rdquo;
       said Mrs. Epanchin, with some show of annoyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s not I alone,&rdquo; cried Colia. &ldquo;They all talked about it, and they
      do still. Why, just now Prince S. and Adelaida Ivanovna declared that they
      upheld &lsquo;the poor knight&rsquo;; so evidently there does exist a &lsquo;poor knight&rsquo;;
      and if it were not for Adelaida Ivanovna, we should have known long ago
      who the &lsquo;poor knight&rsquo; was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, how am I to blame?&rdquo; asked Adelaida, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t draw his portrait for us, that&rsquo;s why you are to blame!
      Aglaya Ivanovna asked you to draw his portrait, and gave you the whole
      subject of the picture. She invented it herself; and you wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was I to draw? According to the lines she quoted:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;&lsquo;From his face he never lifted
    That eternal mask of steel.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of a face was I to draw? I couldn&rsquo;t draw a mask.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you are driving at; what mask do you mean?&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Epanchin, irritably. She began to see pretty clearly though what it meant,
      and whom they referred to by the generally accepted title of &ldquo;poor
      knight.&rdquo; But what specially annoyed her was that the prince was looking so
      uncomfortable, and blushing like a ten-year-old child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, have you finished your silly joke?&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;and am I to be told
      what this &lsquo;poor knight&rsquo; means, or is it a solemn secret which cannot be
      approached lightly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But they all laughed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s simply that there is a Russian poem,&rdquo; began Prince S., evidently
      anxious to change the conversation, &ldquo;a strange thing, without beginning or
      end, and all about a &lsquo;poor knight.&rsquo; A month or so ago, we were all talking
      and laughing, and looking up a subject for one of Adelaida&rsquo;s pictures&mdash;you
      know it is the principal business of this family to find subjects for
      Adelaida&rsquo;s pictures. Well, we happened upon this &lsquo;poor knight.&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t
      remember who thought of it first&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Aglaya Ivanovna did,&rdquo; said Colia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely&mdash;I don&rsquo;t recollect,&rdquo; continued Prince S.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some of us laughed at the subject; some liked it; but she declared that,
      in order to make a picture of the gentleman, she must first see his face.
      We then began to think over all our friends&rsquo; faces to see if any of them
      would do, and none suited us, and so the matter stood; that&rsquo;s all. I don&rsquo;t
      know why Nicolai Ardalionovitch has brought up the joke now. What was
      appropriate and funny then, has quite lost all interest by this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably there&rsquo;s some new silliness about it,&rdquo; said Mrs. Epanchin,
      sarcastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no silliness about it at all&mdash;only the profoundest
      respect,&rdquo; said Aglaya, very seriously. She had quite recovered her temper;
      in fact, from certain signs, it was fair to conclude that she was
      delighted to see this joke going so far; and a careful observer might have
      remarked that her satisfaction dated from the moment when the fact of the
      prince&rsquo;s confusion became apparent to all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Profoundest respect!&rsquo; What nonsense! First, insane giggling, and then,
      all of a sudden, a display of &lsquo;profoundest respect.&rsquo; Why respect? Tell me
      at once, why have you suddenly developed this &lsquo;profound respect,&rsquo; eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; replied Aglaya gravely, &ldquo;in the poem the knight is described as
      a man capable of living up to an ideal all his life. That sort of thing is
      not to be found every day among the men of our times. In the poem it is
      not stated exactly what the ideal was, but it was evidently some vision,
      some revelation of pure Beauty, and the knight wore round his neck,
      instead of a scarf, a rosary. A device&mdash;A. N. B.&mdash;the meaning of
      which is not explained, was inscribed on his shield&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, A. N. D.,&rdquo; corrected Colia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say A. N. B., and so it shall be!&rdquo; cried Aglaya, irritably. &ldquo;Anyway,
      the &lsquo;poor knight&rsquo; did not care what his lady was, or what she did. He had
      chosen his ideal, and he was bound to serve her, and break lances for her,
      and acknowledge her as the ideal of pure Beauty, whatever she might say or
      do afterwards. If she had taken to stealing, he would have championed her
      just the same. I think the poet desired to embody in this one picture the
      whole spirit of medieval chivalry and the platonic love of a pure and
      high-souled knight. Of course it&rsquo;s all an ideal, and in the &lsquo;poor knight&rsquo;
      that spirit reached the utmost limit of asceticism. He is a Don Quixote,
      only serious and not comical. I used not to understand him, and laughed at
      him, but now I love the &lsquo;poor knight,&rsquo; and respect his actions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So ended Aglaya; and, to look at her, it was difficult, indeed, to judge
      whether she was joking or in earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh! he was a fool, and his actions were the actions of a fool,&rdquo; said
      Mrs. Epanchin; &ldquo;and as for you, young woman, you ought to know better. At
      all events, you are not to talk like that again. What poem is it? Recite
      it! I want to hear this poem! I have hated poetry all my life. Prince, you
      must excuse this nonsense. We neither of us like this sort of thing! Be
      patient!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They certainly were put out, both of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince tried to say something, but he was too confused, and could not
      get his words out. Aglaya, who had taken such liberties in her little
      speech, was the only person present, perhaps, who was not in the least
      embarrassed. She seemed, in fact, quite pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      She now rose solemnly from her seat, walked to the centre of the terrace,
      and stood in front of the prince&rsquo;s chair. All looked on with some
      surprise, and Prince S. and her sisters with feelings of decided alarm, to
      see what new frolic she was up to; it had gone quite far enough already,
      they thought. But Aglaya evidently thoroughly enjoyed the affectation and
      ceremony with which she was introducing her recitation of the poem.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Epanchin was just wondering whether she would not forbid the
      performance after all, when, at the very moment that Aglaya commenced her
      declamation, two new guests, both talking loudly, entered from the street.
      The new arrivals were General Epanchin and a young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their entrance caused some slight commotion.
    </p>
    <h3>
      VII.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The young fellow accompanying the general was about twenty-eight, tall,
      and well built, with a handsome and clever face, and bright black eyes,
      full of fun and intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aglaya did not so much as glance at the new arrivals, but went on with her
      recitation, gazing at the prince the while in an affected manner, and at
      him alone. It was clear to him that she was doing all this with some
      special object.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the new guests at least somewhat eased his strained and uncomfortable
      position. Seeing them approaching, he rose from his chair, and nodding
      amicably to the general, signed to him not to interrupt the recitation. He
      then got behind his chair, and stood there with his left hand resting on
      the back of it. Thanks to this change of position, he was able to listen
      to the ballad with far less embarrassment than before. Mrs. Epanchin had
      also twice motioned to the new arrivals to be quiet, and stay where they
      were.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince was much interested in the young man who had just entered. He
      easily concluded that this was Evgenie Pavlovitch Radomski, of whom he had
      already heard mention several times. He was puzzled, however, by the young
      man&rsquo;s plain clothes, for he had always heard of Evgenie Pavlovitch as a
      military man. An ironical smile played on Evgenie&rsquo;s lips all the while the
      recitation was proceeding, which showed that he, too, was probably in the
      secret of the &lsquo;poor knight&rsquo; joke. But it had become quite a different
      matter with Aglaya. All the affectation of manner which she had displayed
      at the beginning disappeared as the ballad proceeded. She spoke the lines
      in so serious and exalted a manner, and with so much taste, that she even
      seemed to justify the exaggerated solemnity with which she had stepped
      forward. It was impossible to discern in her now anything but a deep
      feeling for the spirit of the poem which she had undertaken to interpret.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes were aglow with inspiration, and a slight tremor of rapture
      passed over her lovely features once or twice. She continued to recite:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Once there came a vision glorious,
   Mystic, dreadful, wondrous fair;
   Burned itself into his spirit,
   And abode for ever there!

  &ldquo;Never more&mdash;from that sweet moment&mdash;
   Gazéd he on womankind;
   He was dumb to love and wooing
   And to all their graces blind.

  &ldquo;Full of love for that sweet vision,
   Brave and pure he took the field;
   With his blood he stained the letters
   N. P. B. upon his shield.

  &ldquo;&lsquo;Lumen caeli, sancta Rosa!&rsquo;
   Shouting on the foe he fell,
   And like thunder rang his war-cry
   O&rsquo;er the cowering infidel.

  &ldquo;Then within his distant castle,
   Home returned, he dreamed his days&mdash;
   Silent, sad,&mdash;and when death took him
   He was mad, the legend says.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      When recalling all this afterwards the prince could not for the life of
      him understand how to reconcile the beautiful, sincere, pure nature of the
      girl with the irony of this jest. That it was a jest there was no doubt
      whatever; he knew that well enough, and had good reason, too, for his
      conviction; for during her recitation of the ballad Aglaya had
      deliberately changed the letters A. N. B. into N. P. B. He was quite sure
      she had not done this by accident, and that his ears had not deceived him.
      At all events her performance&mdash;which was a joke, of course, if rather
      a crude one,&mdash;was premeditated. They had evidently talked (and
      laughed) over the &lsquo;poor knight&rsquo; for more than a month.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet Aglaya had brought out these letters N. P. B. not only without the
      slightest appearance of irony, or even any particular accentuation, but
      with so even and unbroken an appearance of seriousness that assuredly
      anyone might have supposed that these initials were the original ones
      written in the ballad. The thing made an uncomfortable impression upon the
      prince. Of course Mrs. Epanchin saw nothing either in the change of
      initials or in the insinuation embodied therein. General Epanchin only
      knew that there was a recitation of verses going on, and took no further
      interest in the matter. Of the rest of the audience, many had understood
      the allusion and wondered both at the daring of the lady and at the motive
      underlying it, but tried to show no sign of their feelings. But Evgenie
      Pavlovitch (as the prince was ready to wager) both comprehended and tried
      his best to show that he comprehended; his smile was too mocking to leave
      any doubt on that point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How beautiful that is!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Epanchin, with sincere admiration.
      &ldquo;Whose is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pushkin&rsquo;s, mama, of course! Don&rsquo;t disgrace us all by showing your
      ignorance,&rdquo; said Adelaida.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As soon as we reach home give it to me to read.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we have a copy of Pushkin in the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are a couple of torn volumes somewhere; they have been lying about
      from time immemorial,&rdquo; added Alexandra.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send Feodor or Alexey up by the very first train to buy a copy, then.&mdash;Aglaya,
      come here&mdash;kiss me, dear, you recited beautifully! but,&rdquo; she added in
      a whisper, &ldquo;if you were sincere I am sorry for you. If it was a joke, I do
      not approve of the feelings which prompted you to do it, and in any case
      you would have done far better not to recite it at all. Do you understand?&mdash;Now
      come along, young woman; we&rsquo;ve sat here too long. I&rsquo;ll speak to you about
      this another time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the prince took the opportunity of greeting General Epanchin,
      and the general introduced Evgenie Pavlovitch to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I caught him up on the way to your house,&rdquo; explained the general. &ldquo;He had
      heard that we were all here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and I heard that you were here, too,&rdquo; added Evgenie Pavlovitch; &ldquo;and
      since I had long promised myself the pleasure of seeking not only your
      acquaintance but your friendship, I did not wish to waste time, but came
      straight on. I am sorry to hear that you are unwell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but I&rsquo;m quite well now, thank you, and very glad to make your
      acquaintance. Prince S. has often spoken to me about you,&rdquo; said Muishkin,
      and for an instant the two men looked intently into one another&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince remarked that Evgenie Pavlovitch&rsquo;s plain clothes had evidently
      made a great impression upon the company present, so much so that all
      other interests seemed to be effaced before this surprising fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      His change of dress was evidently a matter of some importance. Adelaida
      and Alexandra poured out a stream of questions; Prince S., a relative of
      the young man, appeared annoyed; and Ivan Fedorovitch quite excited.
      Aglaya alone was not interested. She merely looked closely at Evgenie for
      a minute, curious perhaps as to whether civil or military clothes became
      him best, then turned away and paid no more attention to him or his
      costume. Lizabetha Prokofievna asked no questions, but it was clear that
      she was uneasy, and the prince fancied that Evgenie was not in her good
      graces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has astonished me,&rdquo; said Ivan Fedorovitch. &ldquo;I nearly fell down with
      surprise. I could hardly believe my eyes when I met him in Petersburg just
      now. Why this haste? That&rsquo;s what I want to know. He has always said
      himself that there is no need to break windows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Evgenie Pavlovitch remarked here that he had spoken of his intention of
      leaving the service long ago. He had, however, always made more or less of
      a joke about it, so no one had taken him seriously. For that matter he
      joked about everything, and his friends never knew what to believe,
      especially if he did not wish them to understand him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have only retired for a time,&rdquo; said he, laughing. &ldquo;For a few months; at
      most for a year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there is no necessity for you to retire at all,&rdquo; complained the
      general, &ldquo;as far as I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to go and look after my country estates. You advised me to do that
      yourself,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;And then I wish to go abroad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a few more expostulations, the conversation drifted into other
      channels, but the prince, who had been an attentive listener, thought all
      this excitement about so small a matter very curious. &ldquo;There must be more
      in it than appears,&rdquo; he said to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see the &lsquo;poor knight&rsquo; has come on the scene again,&rdquo; said Evgenie
      Pavlovitch, stepping to Aglaya&rsquo;s side.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the amazement of the prince, who overheard the remark, Aglaya looked
      haughtily and inquiringly at the questioner, as though she would give him
      to know, once for all, that there could be no talk between them about the
      &lsquo;poor knight,&rsquo; and that she did not understand his question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But not now! It is too late to send to town for a Pushkin now. It is much
      too late, I say!&rdquo; Colia was exclaiming in a loud voice. &ldquo;I have told you
      so at least a hundred times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is really much too late to send to town now,&rdquo; said Evgenie
      Pavlovitch, who had escaped from Aglaya as rapidly as possible. &ldquo;I am sure
      the shops are shut in Petersburg; it is past eight o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; he added,
      looking at his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have done without him so far,&rdquo; interrupted Adelaida in her turn.
      &ldquo;Surely we can wait until to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; said Colia, &ldquo;it is quite unusual, almost improper, for people
      in our position to take any interest in literature. Ask Evgenie Pavlovitch
      if I am not right. It is much more fashionable to drive a waggonette with
      red wheels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You got that from some magazine, Colia,&rdquo; remarked Adelaida.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He gets most of his conversation in that way,&rdquo; laughed Evgenie
      Pavlovitch. &ldquo;He borrows whole phrases from the reviews. I have long had
      the pleasure of knowing both Nicholai Ardalionovitch and his
      conversational methods, but this time he was not repeating something he
      had read; he was alluding, no doubt, to my yellow waggonette, which has,
      or had, red wheels. But I have exchanged it, so you are rather behind the
      times, Colia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince had been listening attentively to Radomski&rsquo;s words, and thought
      his manner very pleasant. When Colia chaffed him about his waggonette he
      had replied with perfect equality and in a friendly fashion. This pleased
      Muishkin.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Vera came up to Lizabetha Prokofievna, carrying several
      large and beautifully bound books, apparently quite new.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; demanded the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Pushkin,&rdquo; replied the girl. &ldquo;Papa told me to offer it to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Impossible!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Epanchin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not as a present, not as a present! I should not have taken the liberty,&rdquo;
       said Lebedeff, appearing suddenly from behind his daughter. &ldquo;It is our own
      Pushkin, our family copy, Annenkoff&rsquo;s edition; it could not be bought now.
      I beg to suggest, with great respect, that your excellency should buy it,
      and thus quench the noble literary thirst which is consuming you at this
      moment,&rdquo; he concluded grandiloquently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! if you will sell it, very good&mdash;and thank you. You shall not be
      a loser! But for goodness&rsquo; sake, don&rsquo;t twist about like that, sir! I have
      heard of you; they tell me you are a very learned person. We must have a
      talk one of these days. You will bring me the books yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With the greatest respect... and... and veneration,&rdquo; replied Lebedeff,
      making extraordinary grimaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, bring them, with or without respect, provided always you do not
      drop them on the way; but on the condition,&rdquo; went on the lady, looking
      full at him, &ldquo;that you do not cross my threshold. I do not intend to
      receive you today. You may send your daughter Vera at once, if you like. I
      am much pleased with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you tell him about them?&rdquo; said Vera impatiently to her father.
      &ldquo;They will come in, whether you announce them or not, and they are
      beginning to make a row. Lef Nicolaievitch,&rdquo;&mdash;she addressed herself
      to the prince&mdash;&ldquo;four men are here asking for you. They have waited
      some time, and are beginning to make a fuss, and papa will not bring them
      in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are these people?&rdquo; said the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say that they have come on business, and they are the kind of men,
      who, if you do not see them here, will follow you about the street. It
      would be better to receive them, and then you will get rid of them.
      Gavrila Ardalionovitch and Ptitsin are both there, trying to make them
      hear reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pavlicheff&rsquo;s son! It is not worth while!&rdquo; cried Lebedeff. &ldquo;There is no
      necessity to see them, and it would be most unpleasant for your
      excellency. They do not deserve...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Pavlicheff&rsquo;s son!&rdquo; cried the prince, much perturbed. &ldquo;I know... I
      know&mdash;but I entrusted this matter to Gavrila Ardalionovitch. He told
      me...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment Gania, accompanied by Ptitsin, came out to the terrace.
      From an adjoining room came a noise of angry voices, and General Ivolgin,
      in loud tones, seemed to be trying to shout them down. Colia rushed off at
      once to investigate the cause of the uproar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is most interesting!&rdquo; observed Evgenie Pavlovitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect he knows all about it!&rdquo; thought the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, the son of Pavlicheff? And who may this son of Pavlicheff be?&rdquo;
       asked General Epanchin with surprise; and looking curiously around him, he
      discovered that he alone had no clue to the mystery. Expectation and
      suspense were on every face, with the exception of that of the prince, who
      stood gravely wondering how an affair so entirely personal could have
      awakened such lively and widespread interest in so short a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aglaya went up to him with a peculiarly serious look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if you put an end to this affair yourself <i>at
      once</i>: but you must allow us to be your witnesses. They want to throw
      mud at you, prince, and you must be triumphantly vindicated. I give you
      joy beforehand!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I also wish for justice to be done, once for all,&rdquo; cried Madame
      Epanchin, &ldquo;about this impudent claim. Deal with them promptly, prince, and
      don&rsquo;t spare them! I am sick of hearing about the affair, and many a
      quarrel I have had in your cause. But I confess I am anxious to see what
      happens, so do make them come out here, and we will remain. You have heard
      people talking about it, no doubt?&rdquo; she added, turning to Prince S.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I have heard it spoken about at your house, and I
      am anxious to see these young men!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are Nihilists, are they not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, they are not Nihilists,&rdquo; explained Lebedeff, who seemed much excited.
      &ldquo;This is another lot&mdash;a special group. According to my nephew they
      are more advanced even than the Nihilists. You are quite wrong,
      excellency, if you think that your presence will intimidate them; nothing
      intimidates them. Educated men, learned men even, are to be found among
      Nihilists; these go further, in that they are men of action. The movement
      is, properly speaking, a derivative from Nihilism&mdash;though they are
      only known indirectly, and by hearsay, for they never advertise their
      doings in the papers. They go straight to the point. For them, it is not a
      question of showing that Pushkin is stupid, or that Russia must be torn in
      pieces. No; but if they have a great desire for anything, they believe
      they have a right to get it even at the cost of the lives, say, of eight
      persons. They are checked by no obstacles. In fact, prince, I should not
      advise you...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Muishkin had risen, and was on his way to open the door for his
      visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are slandering them, Lebedeff,&rdquo; said he, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are always thinking about your nephew&rsquo;s conduct. Don&rsquo;t believe him,
      Lizabetha Prokofievna. I can assure you Gorsky and Daniloff are exceptions&mdash;and
      that these are only... mistaken. However, I do not care about receiving
      them here, in public. Excuse me, Lizabetha Prokofievna. They are coming,
      and you can see them, and then I will take them away. Please come in,
      gentlemen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another thought tormented him: He wondered was this an arranged business&mdash;arranged
      to happen when he had guests in his house, and in anticipation of his
      humiliation rather than of his triumph? But he reproached himself bitterly
      for such a thought, and felt as if he should die of shame if it were
      discovered. When his new visitors appeared, he was quite ready to believe
      himself infinitely less to be respected than any of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four persons entered, led by General Ivolgin, in a state of great
      excitement, and talking eloquently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is for me, undoubtedly!&rdquo; thought the prince, with a smile. Colia also
      had joined the party, and was talking with animation to Hippolyte, who
      listened with a jeering smile on his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince begged the visitors to sit down. They were all so young that it
      made the proceedings seem even more extraordinary. Ivan Fedorovitch, who
      really understood nothing of what was going on, felt indignant at the
      sight of these youths, and would have interfered in some way had it not
      been for the extreme interest shown by his wife in the affair. He
      therefore remained, partly through curiosity, partly through good-nature,
      hoping that his presence might be of some use. But the bow with which
      General Ivolgin greeted him irritated him anew; he frowned, and decided to
      be absolutely silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the rest, one was a man of thirty, the retired officer, now a boxer,
      who had been with Rogojin, and in his happier days had given fifteen
      roubles at a time to beggars. Evidently he had joined the others as a
      comrade to give them moral, and if necessary material, support. The man
      who had been spoken of as &ldquo;Pavlicheff&rsquo;s son,&rdquo; although he gave the name of
      Antip Burdovsky, was about twenty-two years of age, fair, thin and rather
      tall. He was remarkable for the poverty, not to say uncleanliness, of his
      personal appearance: the sleeves of his overcoat were greasy; his dirty
      waistcoat, buttoned up to his neck, showed not a trace of linen; a filthy
      black silk scarf, twisted till it resembled a cord, was round his neck,
      and his hands were unwashed. He looked round with an air of insolent
      effrontery. His face, covered with pimples, was neither thoughtful nor
      even contemptuous; it wore an expression of complacent satisfaction in
      demanding his rights and in being an aggrieved party. His voice trembled,
      and he spoke so fast, and with such stammerings, that he might have been
      taken for a foreigner, though the purest Russian blood ran in his veins.
      Lebedeff&rsquo;s nephew, whom the reader has seen already, accompanied him, and
      also the youth named Hippolyte Terentieff. The latter was only seventeen
      or eighteen. He had an intelligent face, though it was usually irritated
      and fretful in expression. His skeleton-like figure, his ghastly
      complexion, the brightness of his eyes, and the red spots of colour on his
      cheeks, betrayed the victim of consumption to the most casual glance. He
      coughed persistently, and panted for breath; it looked as though he had
      but a few weeks more to live. He was nearly dead with fatigue, and fell,
      rather than sat, into a chair. The rest bowed as they came in; and being
      more or less abashed, put on an air of extreme self-assurance. In short,
      their attitude was not that which one would have expected in men who
      professed to despise all trivialities, all foolish mundane conventions,
      and indeed everything, except their own personal interests.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Antip Burdovsky,&rdquo; stuttered the son of Pavlicheff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vladimir Doktorenko,&rdquo; said Lebedeff&rsquo;s nephew briskly, and with a certain
      pride, as if he boasted of his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keller,&rdquo; murmured the retired officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hippolyte Terentieff,&rdquo; cried the last-named, in a shrill voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat now in a row facing the prince, and frowned, and played with
      their caps. All appeared ready to speak, and yet all were silent; the
      defiant expression on their faces seemed to say, &ldquo;No, sir, you don&rsquo;t take
      us in!&rdquo; It could be felt that the first word spoken by anyone present
      would bring a torrent of speech from the whole deputation.
    </p>
    <h3>
      VIII.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>did</i> not expect you, gentlemen,&rdquo; began the prince. &ldquo;I have been
      ill until to-day. A month ago,&rdquo; he continued, addressing himself to Antip
      Burdovsky, &ldquo;I put your business into Gavrila Ardalionovitch Ivolgin&rsquo;s
      hands, as I told you then. I do not in the least object to having a
      personal interview... but you will agree with me that this is hardly the
      time... I propose that we go into another room, if you will not keep me
      long... As you see, I have friends here, and believe me...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friends as many as you please, but allow me,&rdquo; interrupted the harsh voice
      of Lebedeff&rsquo;s nephew&mdash;&ldquo;allow me to tell you that you might have
      treated us rather more politely, and not have kept us waiting at least two
      hours...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt... and I... is that acting like a prince? And you... you may be
      a general! But I... I am not your valet! And I... I...&rdquo; stammered Antip
      Burdovsky.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was extremely excited; his lips trembled, and the resentment of an
      embittered soul was in his voice. But he spoke so indistinctly that hardly
      a dozen words could be gathered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a princely action!&rdquo; sneered Hippolyte.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If anyone had treated me so,&rdquo; grumbled the boxer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean to say that if I had been in Burdovsky&rsquo;s place...I...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, I did not know you were there; I have only just been informed,
      I assure you,&rdquo; repeated Muishkin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are not afraid of your friends, prince,&rdquo; remarked Lebedeff&rsquo;s nephew,
      &ldquo;for we are within our rights.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The shrill tones of Hippolyte interrupted him. &ldquo;What right have you... by
      what right do you demand us to submit this matter, about Burdovsky... to
      the judgment of your friends? We know only too well what the judgment of
      your friends will be!...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This beginning gave promise of a stormy discussion. The prince was much
      discouraged, but at last he managed to make himself heard amid the
      vociferations of his excited visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you,&rdquo; he said, addressing Burdovsky&mdash;&ldquo;if you prefer not to speak
      here, I offer again to go into another room with you... and as to your
      waiting to see me, I repeat that I only this instant heard...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you have no right, you have no right, no right at all!... Your
      friends indeed!&rdquo;... gabbled Burdovsky, defiantly examining the faces round
      him, and becoming more and more excited. &ldquo;You have no right!...&rdquo; As he
      ended thus abruptly, he leant forward, staring at the prince with his
      short-sighted, bloodshot eyes. The latter was so astonished, that he did
      not reply, but looked steadily at him in return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lef Nicolaievitch!&rdquo; interposed Madame Epanchin, suddenly, &ldquo;read this at
      once, this very moment! It is about this business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She held out a weekly comic paper, pointing to an article on one of its
      pages. Just as the visitors were coming in, Lebedeff, wishing to
      ingratiate himself with the great lady, had pulled this paper from his
      pocket, and presented it to her, indicating a few columns marked in
      pencil. Lizabetha Prokofievna had had time to read some of it, and was
      greatly upset.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would it not be better to peruse it alone... later,&rdquo;  asked the prince,
      nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, read it&mdash;read it at once directly, and aloud, aloud!&rdquo; cried
      she, calling Colia to her and giving him the journal.&mdash;&ldquo;Read it
      aloud, so that everyone may hear it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An impetuous woman, Lizabetha Prokofievna sometimes weighed her anchors
      and put out to sea quite regardless of the possible storms she might
      encounter. Ivan Fedorovitch felt a sudden pang of alarm, but the others
      were merely curious, and somewhat surprised. Colia unfolded the paper, and
      began to read, in his clear, high-pitched voice, the following article:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Proletarians and scions of nobility! An episode of the brigandage of
        today and every day! Progress! Reform! Justice!&rdquo;
       </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Strange things are going on in our so-called Holy Russia in this age of
        reform and great enterprises; this age of patriotism in which hundreds
        of millions are yearly sent abroad; in which industry is encouraged, and
        the hands of Labour paralyzed, etc.; there is no end to this, gentlemen,
        so let us come to the point. A strange thing has happened to a scion of
        our defunct aristocracy. (<i>De profundis!</i>) The grandfathers of
        these scions ruined themselves at the gaming-tables; their fathers were
        forced to serve as officers or subalterns; some have died just as they
        were about to be tried for innocent thoughtlessness in the handling of
        public funds. Their children are sometimes congenital idiots, like the
        hero of our story; sometimes they are found in the dock at the Assizes,
        where they are generally acquitted by the jury for edifying motives;
        sometimes they distinguish themselves by one of those burning scandals
        that amaze the public and add another blot to the stained record of our
        age. Six months ago&mdash;that is, last winter&mdash;this particular
        scion returned to Russia, wearing gaiters like a foreigner, and
        shivering with cold in an old scantily-lined cloak. He had come from
        Switzerland, where he had just undergone a successful course of
        treatment for idiocy (<i>sic!</i>). Certainly Fortune favoured him, for,
        apart from the interesting malady of which he was cured in Switzerland
        (can there be a cure for idiocy?) his story proves the truth of the
        Russian proverb that &lsquo;happiness is the right of certain classes!&rsquo; Judge
        for yourselves. Our subject was an infant in arms when he lost his
        father, an officer who died just as he was about to be court-martialled
        for gambling away the funds of his company, and perhaps also for
        flogging a subordinate to excess (remember the good old days,
        gentlemen). The orphan was brought up by the charity of a very rich
        Russian landowner. In the good old days, this man, whom we will call P&mdash;&mdash;,
        owned four thousand souls as serfs (souls as serfs!&mdash;can you
        understand such an expression, gentlemen? I cannot; it must be looked up
        in a dictionary before one can understand it; these things of a bygone
        day are already unintelligible to us). He appears to have been one of
        those Russian parasites who lead an idle existence abroad, spending the
        summer at some spa, and the winter in Paris, to the greater profit of
        the organizers of public balls. It may safely be said that the manager
        of the Chateau des Fleurs (lucky man!) pocketed at least a third of the
        money paid by Russian peasants to their lords in the days of serfdom.
        However this may be, the gay P&mdash;&mdash; brought up the orphan like
        a prince, provided him with tutors and governesses (pretty, of course!)
        whom he chose himself in Paris. But the little aristocrat, the last of
        his noble race, was an idiot. The governesses, recruited at the Chateau
        des Fleurs, laboured in vain; at twenty years of age their pupil could
        not speak in any language, not even Russian. But ignorance of the latter
        was still excusable. At last P&mdash;&mdash; was seized with a strange
        notion; he imagined that in Switzerland they could change an idiot into
        a man of sense. After all, the idea was quite logical; a parasite and
        landowner naturally supposed that intelligence was a marketable
        commodity like everything else, and that in Switzerland especially it
        could be bought for money. The case was entrusted to a celebrated Swiss
        professor, and cost thousands of roubles; the treatment lasted five
        years. Needless to say, the idiot did not become intelligent, but it is
        alleged that he grew into something more or less resembling a man. At
        this stage P&mdash;&mdash; died suddenly, and, as usual, he had made no
        will and left his affairs in disorder. A crowd of eager claimants arose,
        who cared nothing about any last scion of a noble race undergoing
        treatment in Switzerland, at the expense of the deceased, as a
        congenital idiot. Idiot though he was, the noble scion tried to cheat
        his professor, and they say he succeeded in getting him to continue the
        treatment gratis for two years, by concealing the death of his
        benefactor. But the professor himself was a charlatan. Getting anxious
        at last when no money was forthcoming, and alarmed above all by his
        patient&rsquo;s appetite, he presented him with a pair of old gaiters and a
        shabby cloak and packed him off to Russia, third class. It would seem
        that Fortune had turned her back upon our hero. Not at all; Fortune, who
        lets whole populations die of hunger, showered all her gifts at once
        upon the little aristocrat, like Kryloff&rsquo;s Cloud which passes over an
        arid plain and empties itself into the sea. He had scarcely arrived in
        St. Petersburg, when a relation of his mother&rsquo;s (who was of bourgeois
        origin, of course), died at Moscow. He was a merchant, an Old Believer,
        and he had no children. He left a fortune of several millions in good
        current coin, and everything came to our noble scion, our gaitered
        baron, formerly treated for idiocy in a Swiss lunatic asylum. Instantly
        the scene changed, crowds of friends gathered round our baron, who
        meanwhile had lost his head over a celebrated demi-mondaine; he even
        discovered some relations; moreover a number of young girls of high
        birth burned to be united to him in lawful matrimony. Could anyone
        possibly imagine a better match? Aristocrat, millionaire, and idiot, he
        has every advantage! One might hunt in vain for his equal, even with the
        lantern of Diogenes; his like is not to be had even by getting it made
        to order!&rdquo;
       </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know what this means&rdquo; cried Ivan Fedorovitch, transported
      with indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave off, Colia,&rdquo; begged the prince. Exclamations arose on all sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him go on reading at all costs!&rdquo; ordered Lizabetha Prokofievna,
      evidently preserving her composure by a desperate effort. &ldquo;Prince, if the
      reading is stopped, you and I will quarrel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colia had no choice but to obey. With crimson cheeks he read on
      unsteadily:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But while our young millionaire dwelt as it were in the Empyrean,
        something new occurred. One fine morning a man called upon him, calm and
        severe of aspect, distinguished, but plainly dressed. Politely, but in
        dignified terms, as befitted his errand, he briefly explained the motive
        for his visit. He was a lawyer of enlightened views; his client was a
        young man who had consulted him in confidence. This young man was no
        other than the son of P&mdash;&mdash;, though he bears another name. In
        his youth P&mdash;&mdash;, the sensualist, had seduced a young girl,
        poor but respectable. She was a serf, but had received a European
        education. Finding that a child was expected, he hastened her marriage
        with a man of noble character who had loved her for a long time. He
        helped the young couple for a time, but he was soon obliged to give up,
        for the high-minded husband refused to accept anything from him. Soon
        the careless nobleman forgot all about his former mistress and the child
        she had borne him; then, as we know, he died intestate. P&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;s
        son, born after his mother&rsquo;s marriage, found a true father in the
        generous man whose name he bore. But when he also died, the orphan was
        left to provide for himself, his mother now being an invalid who had
        lost the use of her limbs. Leaving her in a distant province, he came to
        the capital in search of pupils. By dint of daily toil he earned enough
        to enable him to follow the college courses, and at last to enter the
        university. But what can one earn by teaching the children of Russian
        merchants at ten copecks a lesson, especially with an invalid mother to
        keep? Even her death did not much diminish the hardships of the young
        man&rsquo;s struggle for existence. Now this is the question: how, in the name
        of justice, should our scion have argued the case? Our readers will
        think, no doubt, that he would say to himself: &lsquo;P&mdash;&mdash; showered
        benefits upon me all my life; he spent tens of thousands of roubles to
        educate me, to provide me with governesses, and to keep me under
        treatment in Switzerland. Now I am a millionaire, and P&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;s
        son, a noble young man who is not responsible for the faults of his
        careless and forgetful father, is wearing himself out giving ill-paid
        lessons. According to justice, all that was done for me ought to have
        been done for him. The enormous sums spent upon me were not really mine;
        they came to me by an error of blind Fortune, when they ought to have
        gone to P&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;s son. They should have gone to benefit him, not
        me, in whom P&mdash;&mdash; interested himself by a mere caprice,
        instead of doing his duty as a father. If I wished to behave nobly,
        justly, and with delicacy, I ought to bestow half my fortune upon the
        son of my benefactor; but as economy is my favourite virtue, and I know
        this is not a case in which the law can intervene, I will not give up
        half my millions. But it would be too openly vile, too flagrantly
        infamous, if I did not at least restore to P&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;s son the
        tens of thousands of roubles spent in curing my idiocy. This is simply a
        case of conscience and of strict justice. Whatever would have become of
        me if P&mdash;&mdash; had not looked after my education, and had taken
        care of his own son instead of me?&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, gentlemen, our scions of the nobility do not reason thus. The
        lawyer, who had taken up the matter purely out of friendship to the
        young man, and almost against his will, invoked every consideration of
        justice, delicacy, honour, and even plain figures; in vain, the
        ex-patient of the Swiss lunatic asylum was inflexible. All this might
        pass, but the sequel is absolutely unpardonable, and not to be excused
        by any interesting malady. This millionaire, having but just discarded
        the old gaiters of his professor, could not even understand that the
        noble young man slaving away at his lessons was not asking for
        charitable help, but for his rightful due, though the debt was not a
        legal one; that, correctly speaking, he was not asking for anything, but
        it was merely his friends who had thought fit to bestir themselves on
        his behalf. With the cool insolence of a bloated capitalist, secure in
        his millions, he majestically drew a banknote for fifty roubles from his
        pocket-book and sent it to the noble young man as a humiliating piece of
        charity. You can hardly believe it, gentlemen! You are scandalized and
        disgusted; you cry out in indignation! But that is what he did! Needless
        to say, the money was returned, or rather flung back in his face. The
        case is not within the province of the law, it must be referred to the
        tribunal of public opinion; this is what we now do, guaranteeing the
        truth of all the details which we have related.&rdquo;
       </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      When Colia had finished reading, he handed the paper to the prince, and
      retired silently to a corner of the room, hiding his face in his hands. He
      was overcome by a feeling of inexpressible shame; his boyish sensitiveness
      was wounded beyond endurance. It seemed to him that something
      extraordinary, some sudden catastrophe had occurred, and that he was
      almost the cause of it, because he had read the article aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet all the others were similarly affected. The girls were uncomfortable
      and ashamed. Lizabetha Prokofievna restrained her violent anger by a great
      effort; perhaps she bitterly regretted her interference in the matter; for
      the present she kept silence. The prince felt as very shy people often do
      in such a case; he was so ashamed of the conduct of other people, so
      humiliated for his guests, that he dared not look them in the face.
      Ptitsin, Varia, Gania, and Lebedeff himself, all looked rather confused.
      Stranger still, Hippolyte and the &ldquo;son of Pavlicheff&rdquo; also seemed slightly
      surprised, and Lebedeff&rsquo;s nephew was obviously far from pleased. The boxer
      alone was perfectly calm; he twisted his moustaches with affected dignity,
      and if his eyes were cast down it was certainly not in confusion, but
      rather in noble modesty, as if he did not wish to be insolent in his
      triumph. It was evident that he was delighted with the article.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil knows what it means,&rdquo; growled Ivan Fedorovitch, under his
      breath; &ldquo;it must have taken the united wits of fifty footmen to write it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask your reason for such an insulting supposition, sir?&rdquo; said
      Hippolyte, trembling with rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will admit yourself, general, that for an honourable man, if the
      author is an honourable man, that is an&mdash;an insult,&rdquo; growled the
      boxer suddenly, with convulsive jerkings of his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the first place, it is not for you to address me as &lsquo;sir,&rsquo; and, in the
      second place, I refuse to give you any explanation,&rdquo; said Ivan Fedorovitch
      vehemently; and he rose without another word, and went and stood on the
      first step of the flight that led from the verandah to the street, turning
      his back on the company. He was indignant with Lizabetha Prokofievna, who
      did not think of moving even now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, gentlemen, let me speak at last,&rdquo; cried the prince, anxious
      and agitated. &ldquo;Please let us understand one another. I say nothing about
      the article, gentlemen, except that every word is false; I say this
      because you know it as well as I do. It is shameful. I should be surprised
      if any one of you could have written it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not know of its existence till this moment,&rdquo; declared Hippolyte. &ldquo;I
      do not approve of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew it had been written, but I would not have advised its
      publication,&rdquo; said Lebedeff&rsquo;s nephew, &ldquo;because it is premature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew it, but I have a right. I... I...&rdquo; stammered the &ldquo;son of
      Pavlicheff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Did you write all that yourself? Is it possible?&rdquo; asked the prince,
      regarding Burdovsky with curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One might dispute your right to ask such questions,&rdquo; observed Lebedeff&rsquo;s
      nephew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was only surprised that Mr. Burdovsky should have&mdash;however, this
      is what I have to say. Since you had already given the matter publicity,
      why did you object just now, when I began to speak of it to my friends?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last!&rdquo; murmured Lizabetha Prokofievna indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lebedeff could restrain himself no longer; he made his way through the row
      of chairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prince,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you are forgetting that if you consented to receive
      and hear them, it was only because of your kind heart which has no equal,
      for they had not the least right to demand it, especially as you had
      placed the matter in the hands of Gavrila Ardalionovitch, which was also
      extremely kind of you. You are also forgetting, most excellent prince,
      that you are with friends, a select company; you cannot sacrifice them to
      these gentlemen, and it is only for you to have them turned out this
      instant. As the master of the house I shall have great pleasure ....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right!&rdquo; agreed General Ivolgin in a loud voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will do, Lebedeff, that will do&mdash;&rdquo; began the prince, when an
      indignant outcry drowned his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, prince, excuse me, but now that will not do,&rdquo; shouted
      Lebedeff&rsquo;s nephew, his voice dominating all the others. &ldquo;The matter must
      be clearly stated, for it is obviously not properly understood. They are
      calling in some legal chicanery, and upon that ground they are threatening
      to turn us out of the house! Really, prince, do you think we are such
      fools as not to be aware that this matter does not come within the law,
      and that legally we cannot claim a rouble from you? But we are also aware
      that if actual law is not on our side, human law is for us, natural law,
      the law of common-sense and conscience, which is no less binding upon
      every noble and honest man&mdash;that is, every man of sane judgment&mdash;because
      it is not to be found in miserable legal codes. If we come here without
      fear of being turned out (as was threatened just now) because of the
      imperative tone of our demand, and the unseemliness of such a visit at
      this late hour (though it was not late when we arrived, we were kept
      waiting in your anteroom), if, I say, we came in without fear, it is just
      because we expected to find you a man of sense; I mean, a man of honour
      and conscience. It is quite true that we did not present ourselves humbly,
      like your flatterers and parasites, but holding up our heads as befits
      independent men. We present no petition, but a proud and free demand (note
      it well, we do not beseech, we demand!). We ask you fairly and squarely in
      a dignified manner. Do you believe that in this affair of Burdovsky you
      have right on your side? Do you admit that Pavlicheff overwhelmed you with
      benefits, and perhaps saved your life? If you admit it (which we take for
      granted), do you intend, now that you are a millionaire, and do you not
      think it in conformity with justice, to indemnify Burdovsky? Yes or no? If
      it is yes, or, in other words, if you possess what you call honour and
      conscience, and we more justly call common-sense, then accede to our
      demand, and the matter is at an end. Give us satisfaction, without
      entreaties or thanks from us; do not expect thanks from us, for what you
      do will be done not for our sake, but for the sake of justice. If you
      refuse to satisfy us, that is, if your answer is no, we will go away at
      once, and there will be an end of the matter. But we will tell you to your
      face before the present company that you are a man of vulgar and
      undeveloped mind; we will openly deny you the right to speak in future of
      your honour and conscience, for you have not paid the fair price of such a
      right. I have no more to say&mdash;I have put the question before you. Now
      turn us out if you dare. You can do it; force is on your side. But
      remember that we do not beseech, we demand! We do not beseech, we demand!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these last excited words, Lebedeff&rsquo;s nephew was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We demand, we demand, we demand, we do not beseech,&rdquo; spluttered
      Burdovsky, red as a lobster.
    </p>
    <p>
      The speech of Lebedeff&rsquo;s nephew caused a certain stir among the company;
      murmurs arose, though with the exception of Lebedeff, who was still very
      much excited, everyone was careful not to interfere in the matter.
      Strangely enough, Lebedeff, although on the prince&rsquo;s side, seemed quite
      proud of his nephew&rsquo;s eloquence. Gratified vanity was visible in the
      glances he cast upon the assembled company.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my opinion, Mr. Doktorenko,&rdquo; said the prince, in rather a low voice,
      &ldquo;you are quite right in at least half of what you say. I would go further
      and say that you are altogether right, and that I quite agree with you, if
      there were not something lacking in your speech. I cannot undertake to say
      precisely what it is, but you have certainly omitted something, and you
      cannot be quite just while there is something lacking. But let us put that
      aside and return to the point. Tell me what induced you to publish this
      article. Every word of it is a calumny, and I think, gentlemen, that you
      have been guilty of a mean action.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allow me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? What? What?&rdquo; cried all the visitors at once, in violent agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to the article,&rdquo; said Hippolyte in his croaking voice, &ldquo;I have told
      you already that we none of us approve of it! There is the writer,&rdquo; he
      added, pointing to the boxer, who sat beside him. &ldquo;I quite admit that he
      has written it in his old regimental manner, with an equal disregard for
      style and decency. I know he is a cross between a fool and an adventurer;
      I make no bones about telling him so to his face every day. But after all
      he is half justified; publicity is the lawful right of every man;
      consequently, Burdovsky is not excepted. Let him answer for his own
      blunders. As to the objection which I made just now in the name of all, to
      the presence of your friends, I think I ought to explain, gentlemen, that
      I only did so to assert our rights, though we really wished to have
      witnesses; we had agreed unanimously upon the point before we came in. We
      do not care who your witnesses may be, or whether they are your friends or
      not. As they cannot fail to recognize Burdovsky&rsquo;s right (seeing that it is
      mathematically demonstrable), it is just as well that the witnesses should
      be your friends. The truth will only be more plainly evident.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is quite true; we had agreed upon that point,&rdquo; said Lebedeff&rsquo;s nephew,
      in confirmation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that is the case, why did you begin by making such a fuss about it?&rdquo;
       asked the astonished prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boxer was dying to get in a few words; owing, no doubt, to the
      presence of the ladies, he was becoming quite jovial.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to the article, prince,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I admit that I wrote it, in spite
      of the severe criticism of my poor friend, in whom I always overlook many
      things because of his unfortunate state of health. But I wrote and
      published it in the form of a letter, in the paper of a friend. I showed
      it to no one but Burdovsky, and I did not read it all through, even to
      him. He immediately gave me permission to publish it, but you will admit
      that I might have done so without his consent. Publicity is a noble,
      beneficent, and universal right. I hope, prince, that you are too
      progressive to deny this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I deny nothing, but you must confess that your article&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is a bit thick, you mean? Well, in a way that is in the public interest;
      you will admit that yourself, and after all one cannot overlook a blatant
      fact. So much the worse for the guilty parties, but the public welfare
      must come before everything. As to certain inaccuracies and figures of
      speech, so to speak, you will also admit that the motive, aim, and
      intention, are the chief thing. It is a question, above all, of making a
      wholesome example; the individual case can be examined afterwards; and as
      to the style&mdash;well, the thing was meant to be humorous, so to speak,
      and, after all, everybody writes like that; you must admit it yourself!
      Ha, ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, gentlemen, I assure you that you are quite astray,&rdquo; exclaimed the
      prince. &ldquo;You have published this article upon the supposition that I would
      never consent to satisfy Mr. Burdovsky. Acting on that conviction, you
      have tried to intimidate me by this publication and to be revenged for my
      supposed refusal. But what did you know of my intentions? It may be that I
      have resolved to satisfy Mr. Burdovsky&rsquo;s claim. I now declare openly, in
      the presence of these witnesses, that I will do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The noble and intelligent word of an intelligent and most noble man, at
      last!&rdquo; exclaimed the boxer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; exclaimed Lizabetha Prokofievna involuntarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is intolerable,&rdquo; growled the general.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allow me, gentlemen, allow me,&rdquo; urged the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will explain matters to you. Five weeks ago I received a visit from
      Tchebaroff, your agent, Mr. Burdovsky. You have given a very flattering
      description of him in your article, Mr. Keller,&rdquo; he continued, turning to
      the boxer with a smile, &ldquo;but he did not please me at all. I saw at once
      that Tchebaroff was the moving spirit in the matter, and, to speak
      frankly, I thought he might have induced you, Mr. Burdovsky, to make this
      claim, by taking advantage of your simplicity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no right.... I am not simple,&rdquo; stammered Burdovsky, much
      agitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no sort of right to suppose such things,&rdquo; said Lebedeff&rsquo;s nephew
      in a tone of authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is most offensive!&rdquo; shrieked Hippolyte; &ldquo;it is an insulting
      suggestion, false, and most ill-timed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, gentlemen; please excuse me,&rdquo; said the prince. &ldquo;I
      thought absolute frankness on both sides would be best, but have it your
      own way. I told Tchebaroff that, as I was not in Petersburg, I would
      commission a friend to look into the matter without delay, and that I
      would let you know, Mr. Burdovsky. Gentlemen, I have no hesitation in
      telling you that it was the fact of Tchebaroff&rsquo;s intervention that made me
      suspect a fraud. Oh! do not take offence at my words, gentlemen, for
      Heaven&rsquo;s sake do not be so touchy!&rdquo; cried the prince, seeing that
      Burdovsky was getting excited again, and that the rest were preparing to
      protest. &ldquo;If I say I suspected a fraud, there is nothing personal in that.
      I had never seen any of you then; I did not even know your names; I only
      judged by Tchebaroff; I am speaking quite generally&mdash;if you only knew
      how I have been &lsquo;done&rsquo; since I came into my fortune!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are shockingly naive, prince,&rdquo; said Lebedeff&rsquo;s nephew in mocking
      tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides, though you are a prince and a millionaire, and even though you
      may really be simple and good-hearted, you can hardly be outside the
      general law,&rdquo; Hippolyte declared loudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not; it is very possible,&rdquo; the prince agreed hastily, &ldquo;though I
      do not know what general law you allude to. I will go on&mdash;only please
      do not take offence without good cause. I assure you I do not mean to
      offend you in the least. Really, it is impossible to speak three words
      sincerely without your flying into a rage! At first I was amazed when
      Tchebaroff told me that Pavlicheff had a son, and that he was in such a
      miserable position. Pavlicheff was my benefactor, and my father&rsquo;s friend.
      Oh, Mr. Keller, why does your article impute things to my father without
      the slightest foundation? He never squandered the funds of his company nor
      ill-treated his subordinates, I am absolutely certain of it; I cannot
      imagine how you could bring yourself to write such a calumny! But your
      assertions concerning Pavlicheff are absolutely intolerable! You do not
      scruple to make a libertine of that noble man; you call him a sensualist
      as coolly as if you were speaking the truth, and yet it would not be
      possible to find a chaster man. He was even a scholar of note, and in
      correspondence with several celebrated scientists, and spent large sums in
      the interests of science. As to his kind heart and his good actions, you
      were right indeed when you said that I was almost an idiot at that time,
      and could hardly understand anything&mdash;(I could speak and understand
      Russian, though),&mdash;but now I can appreciate what I remember&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; interrupted Hippolyte, &ldquo;is not this rather sentimental? You
      said you wished to come to the point; please remember that it is after
      nine o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, gentlemen&mdash;very well,&rdquo; replied the prince. &ldquo;At first I
      received the news with mistrust, then I said to myself that I might be
      mistaken, and that Pavlicheff might possibly have had a son. But I was
      absolutely amazed at the readiness with which the son had revealed the
      secret of his birth at the expense of his mother&rsquo;s honour. For Tchebaroff
      had already menaced me with publicity in our interview....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What nonsense!&rdquo; Lebedeff&rsquo;s nephew interrupted violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no right&mdash;you have no right!&rdquo; cried Burdovsky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The son is not responsible for the misdeeds of his father; and the mother
      is not to blame,&rdquo; added Hippolyte, with warmth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That seems to me all the more reason for sparing her,&rdquo; said the prince
      timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prince, you are not only simple, but your simplicity is almost past the
      limit,&rdquo; said Lebedeff&rsquo;s nephew, with a sarcastic smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what right had you?&rdquo; said Hippolyte in a very strange tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None&mdash;none whatever,&rdquo; agreed the prince hastily. &ldquo;I admit you are
      right there, but it was involuntary, and I immediately said to myself that
      my personal feelings had nothing to do with it,&mdash;that if I thought it
      right to satisfy the demands of Mr. Burdovsky, out of respect for the
      memory of Pavlicheff, I ought to do so in any case, whether I esteemed Mr.
      Burdovsky or not. I only mentioned this, gentlemen, because it seemed so
      unnatural to me for a son to betray his mother&rsquo;s secret in such a way. In
      short, that is what convinced me that Tchebaroff must be a rogue, and that
      he had induced Mr. Burdovsky to attempt this fraud.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this is intolerable!&rdquo; cried the visitors, some of them starting to
      their feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, I supposed from this that poor Mr. Burdovsky must be a
      simple-minded man, quite defenceless, and an easy tool in the hands of
      rogues. That is why I thought it my duty to try and help him as
      &lsquo;Pavlicheff&rsquo;s son&rsquo;; in the first place by rescuing him from the influence
      of Tchebaroff, and secondly by making myself his friend. I have resolved
      to give him ten thousand roubles; that is about the sum which I calculate
      that Pavlicheff must have spent on me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, only ten thousand!&rdquo; cried Hippolyte.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, prince, your arithmetic is not up to much, or else you are mighty
      clever at it, though you affect the air of a simpleton,&rdquo; said Lebedeff&rsquo;s
      nephew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not accept ten thousand roubles,&rdquo; said Burdovsky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Accept, Antip,&rdquo; whispered the boxer eagerly, leaning past the back of
      Hippolyte&rsquo;s chair to give his friend this piece of advice. &ldquo;Take it for
      the present; we can see about more later on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Mr. Muishkin,&rdquo; shouted Hippolyte, &ldquo;please understand that we
      are not fools, nor idiots, as your guests seem to imagine; these ladies
      who look upon us with such scorn, and especially this fine gentleman&rdquo;
       (pointing to Evgenie Pavlovitch) &ldquo;whom I have not the honour of knowing,
      though I think I have heard some talk about him&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, really, gentlemen,&rdquo; cried the prince in great agitation, &ldquo;you are
      misunderstanding me again. In the first place, Mr. Keller, you have
      greatly overestimated my fortune in your article. I am far from being a
      millionaire. I have barely a tenth of what you suppose. Secondly, my
      treatment in Switzerland was very far from costing tens of thousands of
      roubles. Schneider received six hundred roubles a year, and he was only
      paid for the first three years. As to the pretty governesses whom
      Pavlicheff is supposed to have brought from Paris, they only exist in Mr.
      Keller&rsquo;s imagination; it is another calumny. According to my calculations,
      the sum spent on me was very considerably under ten thousand roubles, but
      I decided on that sum, and you must admit that in paying a debt I could
      not offer Mr. Burdovsky more, however kindly disposed I might be towards
      him; delicacy forbids it; I should seem to be offering him charity instead
      of rightful payment. I don&rsquo;t know how you cannot see that, gentlemen!
      Besides, I had no intention of leaving the matter there. I meant to
      intervene amicably later on and help to improve poor Mr. Burdovsky&rsquo;s
      position. It is clear that he has been deceived, or he would never have
      agreed to anything so vile as the scandalous revelations about his mother
      in Mr. Keller&rsquo;s article. But, gentlemen, why are you getting angry again?
      Are we never to come to an understanding? Well, the event has proved me
      right! I have just seen with my own eyes the proof that my conjecture was
      correct!&rdquo; he added, with increasing eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He meant to calm his hearers, and did not perceive that his words had only
      increased their irritation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean? What are you convinced of?&rdquo; they demanded angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the first place, I have had the opportunity of getting a correct idea
      of Mr. Burdovsky. I see what he is for myself. He is an innocent man,
      deceived by everyone! A defenceless victim, who deserves indulgence!
      Secondly, Gavrila Ardalionovitch, in whose hands I had placed the matter,
      had his first interview with me barely an hour ago. I had not heard from
      him for some time, as I was away, and have been ill for three days since
      my return to St. Petersburg. He tells me that he has exposed the designs
      of Tchebaroff and has proof that justifies my opinion of him. I know,
      gentlemen, that many people think me an idiot. Counting upon my reputation
      as a man whose purse-strings are easily loosened, Tchebaroff thought it
      would be a simple matter to fleece me, especially by trading on my
      gratitude to Pavlicheff. But the main point is&mdash;listen, gentlemen,
      let me finish!&mdash;the main point is that Mr. Burdovsky is not
      Pavlicheff&rsquo;s son at all. Gavrila Ardalionovitch has just told me of his
      discovery, and assures me that he has positive proofs. Well, what do you
      think of that? It is scarcely credible, even after all the tricks that
      have been played upon me. Please note that we have positive proofs! I can
      hardly believe it myself, I assure you; I do not yet believe it; I am
      still doubtful, because Gavrila Ardalionovitch has not had time to go into
      details; but there can be no further doubt that Tchebaroff is a rogue! He
      has deceived poor Mr. Burdovsky, and all of you, gentlemen, who have come
      forward so nobly to support your friend&mdash;(he evidently needs support,
      I quite see that!). He has abused your credulity and involved you all in
      an attempted fraud, for when all is said and done this claim is nothing
      else!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! a fraud? What, he is not Pavlicheff&rsquo;s son? Impossible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These exclamations but feebly expressed the profound bewilderment into
      which the prince&rsquo;s words had plunged Burdovsky&rsquo;s companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly it is a fraud! Since Mr. Burdovsky is not Pavlicheff&rsquo;s son, his
      claim is neither more nor less than attempted fraud (supposing, of course,
      that he had known the truth), but the fact is that he has been deceived. I
      insist on this point in order to justify him; I repeat that his
      simple-mindedness makes him worthy of pity, and that he cannot stand
      alone; otherwise he would have behaved like a scoundrel in this matter.
      But I feel certain that he does not understand it! I was just the same
      myself before I went to Switzerland; I stammered incoherently; one tries
      to express oneself and cannot. I understand that. I am all the better able
      to pity Mr. Burdovsky, because I know from experience what it is to be
      like that, and so I have a right to speak. Well, though there is no such
      person as &lsquo;Pavlicheff&rsquo;s son,&rsquo; and it is all nothing but a humbug, yet I
      will keep to my decision, and I am prepared to give up ten thousand
      roubles in memory of Pavlicheff. Before Mr. Burdovsky made this claim, I
      proposed to found a school with this money, in memory of my benefactor,
      but I shall honour his memory quite as well by giving the ten thousand
      roubles to Mr. Burdovsky, because, though he was not Pavlicheff&rsquo;s son, he
      was treated almost as though he were. That is what gave a rogue the
      opportunity of deceiving him; he really did think himself Pavlicheff&rsquo;s
      son. Listen, gentlemen; this matter must be settled; keep calm; do not get
      angry; and sit down! Gavrila Ardalionovitch will explain everything to you
      at once, and I confess that I am very anxious to hear all the details
      myself. He says that he has even been to Pskoff to see your mother, Mr.
      Burdovsky; she is not dead, as the article which was just read to us makes
      out. Sit down, gentlemen, sit down!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince sat down, and at length prevailed upon Burdovsky&rsquo;s company to
      do likewise. During the last ten or twenty minutes, exasperated by
      continual interruptions, he had raised his voice, and spoken with great
      vehemence. Now, no doubt, he bitterly regretted several words and
      expressions which had escaped him in his excitement. If he had not been
      driven beyond the limits of endurance, he would not have ventured to
      express certain conjectures so openly. He had no sooner sat down than his
      heart was torn by sharp remorse. Besides insulting Burdovsky with the
      supposition, made in the presence of witnesses, that he was suffering from
      the complaint for which he had himself been treated in Switzerland, he
      reproached himself with the grossest indelicacy in having offered him the
      ten thousand roubles before everyone. &ldquo;I ought to have waited till
      to-morrow and offered him the money when we were alone,&rdquo; thought Muishkin.
      &ldquo;Now it is too late, the mischief is done! Yes, I am an idiot, an absolute
      idiot!&rdquo; he said to himself, overcome with shame and regret.
    </p>
    <p>
      Till then Gavrila Ardalionovitch had sat apart in silence. When the prince
      called upon him, he came and stood by his side, and in a calm, clear voice
      began to render an account of the mission confided to him. All
      conversation ceased instantly. Everyone, especially the Burdovsky party,
      listened with the utmost curiosity.
    </p>
    <h3>
      IX.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not deny, I am sure,&rdquo; said Gavrila Ardalionovitch, turning to
      Burdovsky, who sat looking at him with wide-open eyes, perplexed and
      astonished. &ldquo;You will not deny, seriously, that you were born just two
      years after your mother&rsquo;s legal marriage to Mr. Burdovsky, your father.
      Nothing would be easier than to prove the date of your birth from
      well-known facts; we can only look on Mr. Keller&rsquo;s version as a work of
      imagination, and one, moreover, extremely offensive both to you and your
      mother. Of course he distorted the truth in order to strengthen your
      claim, and to serve your interests. Mr. Keller said that he previously
      consulted you about his article in the paper, but did not read it to you
      as a whole. Certainly he could not have read that passage...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a matter of fact, I did not read it,&rdquo; interrupted the boxer, &ldquo;but its
      contents had been given me on unimpeachable authority, and I...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, Mr. Keller,&rdquo; interposed Gavrila Ardalionovitch. &ldquo;Allow me to
      speak. I assure you your article shall be mentioned in its proper place,
      and you can then explain everything, but for the moment I would rather not
      anticipate. Quite accidentally, with the help of my sister, Varvara
      Ardalionovna Ptitsin, I obtained from one of her intimate friends, Madame
      Zoubkoff, a letter written to her twenty-five years ago, by Nicolai
      Andreevitch Pavlicheff, then abroad. After getting into communication with
      this lady, I went by her advice to Timofei Fedorovitch Viazovkin, a
      retired colonel, and one of Pavlicheff&rsquo;s oldest friends. He gave me two
      more letters written by the latter when he was still in foreign parts.
      These three documents, their dates, and the facts mentioned in them, prove
      in the most undeniable manner, that eighteen months before your birth,
      Nicolai Andreevitch went abroad, where he remained for three consecutive
      years. Your mother, as you are well aware, has never been out of
      Russia.... It is too late to read the letters now; I am content to state
      the fact. But if you desire it, come to me tomorrow morning, bring
      witnesses and writing experts with you, and I will prove the absolute
      truth of my story. From that moment the question will be decided.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words caused a sensation among the listeners, and there was a
      general movement of relief. Burdovsky got up abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that is true,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have been deceived, grossly deceived, but
      not by Tchebaroff: and for a long time past, a long time. I do not wish
      for experts, not I, nor to go to see you. I believe you. I give it up....
      But I refuse the ten thousand roubles. Good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait five minutes more, Mr. Burdovsky,&rdquo; said Gavrila Ardalionovitch
      pleasantly. &ldquo;I have more to say. Some rather curious and important facts
      have come to light, and it is absolutely necessary, in my opinion, that
      you should hear them. You will not regret, I fancy, to have the whole
      matter thoroughly cleared up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Burdovsky silently resumed his seat, and bent his head as though in
      profound thought. His friend, Lebedeff&rsquo;s nephew, who had risen to
      accompany him, also sat down again. He seemed much disappointed, though as
      self-confident as ever. Hippolyte looked dejected and sulky, as well as
      surprised. He had just been attacked by a violent fit of coughing, so that
      his handkerchief was stained with blood. The boxer looked thoroughly
      frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Antip!&rdquo; cried he in a miserable voice, &ldquo;I did say to you the other
      day&mdash;the day before yesterday&mdash;that perhaps you were not really
      Pavlicheff&rsquo;s son!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There were sounds of half-smothered laughter at this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, that is a valuable piece of information, Mr. Keller,&rdquo; replied Gania.
      &ldquo;However that may be, I have private information which convinces me that
      Mr. Burdovsky, though doubtless aware of the date of his birth, knew
      nothing at all about Pavlicheff&rsquo;s sojourn abroad. Indeed, he passed the
      greater part of his life out of Russia, returning at intervals for short
      visits. The journey in question is in itself too unimportant for his
      friends to recollect it after more than twenty years; and of course Mr.
      Burdovsky could have known nothing about it, for he was not born. As the
      event has proved, it was not impossible to find evidence of his absence,
      though I must confess that chance has helped me in a quest which might
      very well have come to nothing. It was really almost impossible for
      Burdovsky or Tchebaroff to discover these facts, even if it had entered
      their heads to try. Naturally they never dreamt...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the voice of Hippolyte suddenly intervened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allow me, Mr. Ivolgin,&rdquo; he said irritably. &ldquo;What is the good of all this
      rigmarole? Pardon me. All is now clear, and we acknowledge the truth of
      your main point. Why go into these tedious details? You wish perhaps to
      boast of the cleverness of your investigation, to cry up your talents as
      detective? Or perhaps your intention is to excuse Burdovsky, by proving
      that he took up the matter in ignorance? Well, I consider that extremely
      impudent on your part! You ought to know that Burdovsky has no need of
      being excused or justified by you or anyone else! It is an insult! The
      affair is quite painful enough for him without that. Will nothing make you
      understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough! enough! Mr. Terentieff,&rdquo; interrupted Gania.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t excite yourself; you seem very ill, and I am sorry for that. I am
      almost done, but there are a few facts to which I must briefly refer, as I
      am convinced that they ought to be clearly explained once for all....&rdquo; A
      movement of impatience was noticed in his audience as he resumed: &ldquo;I
      merely wish to state, for the information of all concerned, that the
      reason for Mr. Pavlicheff&rsquo;s interest in your mother, Mr. Burdovsky, was
      simply that she was the sister of a serf-girl with whom he was deeply in
      love in his youth, and whom most certainly he would have married but for
      her sudden death. I have proofs that this circumstance is almost, if not
      quite, forgotten. I may add that when your mother was about ten years old,
      Pavlicheff took her under his care, gave her a good education, and later,
      a considerable dowry. His relations were alarmed, and feared he might go
      so far as to marry her, but she gave her hand to a young land-surveyor
      named Burdovsky when she reached the age of twenty. I can even say
      definitely that it was a marriage of affection. After his wedding your
      father gave up his occupation as land-surveyor, and with his wife&rsquo;s dowry
      of fifteen thousand roubles went in for commercial speculations. As he had
      had no experience, he was cheated on all sides, and took to drink in order
      to forget his troubles. He shortened his life by his excesses, and eight
      years after his marriage he died. Your mother says herself that she was
      left in the direst poverty, and would have died of starvation had it not
      been for Pavlicheff, who generously allowed her a yearly pension of six
      hundred roubles. Many people recall his extreme fondness for you as a
      little boy. Your mother confirms this, and agrees with others in thinking
      that he loved you the more because you were a sickly child, stammering in
      your speech, and almost deformed&mdash;for it is known that all his life
      Nicolai Andreevitch had a partiality for unfortunates of every kind,
      especially children. In my opinion this is most important. I may add that
      I discovered yet another fact, the last on which I employed my detective
      powers. Seeing how fond Pavlicheff was of you,&mdash;it was thanks to him
      you went to school, and also had the advantage of special teachers&mdash;his
      relations and servants grew to believe that you were his son, and that
      your father had been betrayed by his wife. I may point out that this idea
      was only accredited generally during the last years of Pavlicheff&rsquo;s life,
      when his next-of-kin were trembling about the succession, when the earlier
      story was quite forgotten, and when all opportunity for discovering the
      truth had seemingly passed away. No doubt you, Mr. Burdovsky, heard this
      conjecture, and did not hesitate to accept it as true. I have had the
      honour of making your mother&rsquo;s acquaintance, and I find that she knows all
      about these reports. What she does not know is that you, her son, should
      have listened to them so complaisantly. I found your respected mother at
      Pskoff, ill and in deep poverty, as she has been ever since the death of
      your benefactor. She told me with tears of gratitude how you had supported
      her; she expects much of you, and believes fervently in your future
      success...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, this is unbearable!&rdquo; said Lebedeff&rsquo;s nephew impatiently. &ldquo;What is the
      good of all this romancing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is revolting and unseemly!&rdquo; cried Hippolyte, jumping up in a fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burdovsky alone sat silent and motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the good of it?&rdquo; repeated Gavrila Ardalionovitch, with pretended
      surprise. &ldquo;Well, firstly, because now perhaps Mr. Burdovsky is quite
      convinced that Mr. Pavlicheff&rsquo;s love for him came simply from generosity
      of soul, and not from paternal duty. It was most necessary to impress this
      fact upon his mind, considering that he approved of the article written by
      Mr. Keller. I speak thus because I look on you, Mr. Burdovsky, as an
      honourable man. Secondly, it appears that there was no intention of
      cheating in this case, even on the part of Tchebaroff. I wish to say this
      quite plainly, because the prince hinted a while ago that I too thought it
      an attempt at robbery and extortion. On the contrary, everyone has been
      quite sincere in the matter, and although Tchebaroff may be somewhat of a
      rogue, in this business he has acted simply as any sharp lawyer would do
      under the circumstances. He looked at it as a case that might bring him in
      a lot of money, and he did not calculate badly; because on the one hand he
      speculated on the generosity of the prince, and his gratitude to the late
      Mr. Pavlicheff, and on the other to his chivalrous ideas as to the
      obligations of honour and conscience. As to Mr. Burdovsky, allowing for
      his principles, we may acknowledge that he engaged in the business with
      very little personal aim in view. At the instigation of Tchebaroff and his
      other friends, he decided to make the attempt in the service of truth,
      progress, and humanity. In short, the conclusion may be drawn that, in
      spite of all appearances, Mr. Burdovsky is a man of irreproachable
      character, and thus the prince can all the more readily offer him his
      friendship, and the assistance of which he spoke just now...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! hush! Gavrila Ardalionovitch!&rdquo; cried Muishkin in dismay, but it was
      too late.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said, and I have repeated it over and over again,&rdquo; shouted Burdovsky
      furiously, &ldquo;that I did not want the money. I will not take it... why...I
      will not... I am going away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was rushing hurriedly from the terrace, when Lebedeff&rsquo;s nephew seized
      his arms, and said something to him in a low voice. Burdovsky turned
      quickly, and drawing an addressed but unsealed envelope from his pocket,
      he threw it down on a little table beside the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the money!... How dare you?... The money!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those are the two hundred and fifty roubles you dared to send him as a
      charity, by the hands of Tchebaroff,&rdquo; explained Doktorenko.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The article in the newspaper put it at fifty!&rdquo; cried Colia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said the prince, going up to Burdovsky. &ldquo;I have done
      you a great wrong, but I did not send you that money as a charity, believe
      me. And now I am again to blame. I offended you just now.&rdquo; (The prince was
      much distressed; he seemed worn out with fatigue, and spoke almost
      incoherently.) &ldquo;I spoke of swindling... but I did not apply that to you. I
      was deceived .... I said you were... afflicted... like me... But you are
      not like me... you give lessons... you support your mother. I said you had
      dishonoured your mother, but you love her. She says so herself... I did
      not know... Gavrila Ardalionovitch did not tell me that... Forgive me! I
      dared to offer you ten thousand roubles, but I was wrong. I ought to have
      done it differently, and now... there is no way of doing it, for you
      despise me...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I declare, this is a lunatic asylum!&rdquo; cried Lizabetha Prokofievna.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it is a lunatic asylum!&rdquo; repeated Aglaya sharply, but her words
      were overpowered by other voices. Everybody was talking loudly, making
      remarks and comments; some discussed the affair gravely, others laughed.
      Ivan Fedorovitch Epanchin was extremely indignant. He stood waiting for
      his wife with an air of offended dignity. Lebedeff&rsquo;s nephew took up the
      word again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, prince, to do you justice, you certainly know how to make the most
      of your&mdash;let us call it infirmity, for the sake of politeness; you
      have set about offering your money and friendship in such a way that no
      self-respecting man could possibly accept them. This is an excess of
      ingenuousness or of malice&mdash;you ought to know better than anyone
      which word best fits the case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allow me, gentlemen,&rdquo; said Gavrila Ardalionovitch, who had just examined
      the contents of the envelope, &ldquo;there are only a hundred roubles here, not
      two hundred and fifty. I point this out, prince, to prevent
      misunderstanding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, never mind,&rdquo; said the prince, signing to him to keep quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we do mind,&rdquo; said Lebedeff&rsquo;s nephew vehemently. &ldquo;Prince, your &lsquo;never
      mind&rsquo; is an insult to us. We have nothing to hide; our actions can bear
      daylight. It is true that there are only a hundred roubles instead of two
      hundred and fifty, but it is all the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no, it is hardly the same,&rdquo; remarked Gavrila Ardalionovitch, with an
      air of ingenuous surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t interrupt, we are not such fools as you think, Mr. Lawyer,&rdquo; cried
      Lebedeff&rsquo;s nephew angrily. &ldquo;Of course there is a difference between a
      hundred roubles and two hundred and fifty, but in this case the principle
      is the main point, and that a hundred and fifty roubles are missing is
      only a side issue. The point to be emphasized is that Burdovsky will not
      accept your highness&rsquo;s charity; he flings it back in your face, and it
      scarcely matters if there are a hundred roubles or two hundred and fifty.
      Burdovsky has refused ten thousand roubles; you heard him. He would not
      have returned even a hundred roubles if he was dishonest! The hundred and
      fifty roubles were paid to Tchebaroff for his travelling expenses. You may
      jeer at our stupidity and at our inexperience in business matters; you
      have done all you could already to make us look ridiculous; but do not
      dare to call us dishonest. The four of us will club together every day to
      repay the hundred and fifty roubles to the prince, if we have to pay it in
      instalments of a rouble at a time, but we will repay it, with interest.
      Burdovsky is poor, he has no millions. After his journey to see the prince
      Tchebaroff sent in his bill. We counted on winning... Who would not have
      done the same in such a case?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who indeed?&rdquo; exclaimed Prince S.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall certainly go mad, if I stay here!&rdquo; cried Lizabetha Prokofievna.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It reminds me,&rdquo; said Evgenie Pavlovitch, laughing, &ldquo;of the famous plea of
      a certain lawyer who lately defended a man for murdering six people in
      order to rob them. He excused his client on the score of poverty. &lsquo;It is
      quite natural,&rsquo; he said in conclusion, &lsquo;considering the state of misery he
      was in, that he should have thought of murdering these six people; which
      of you, gentlemen, would not have done the same in his place?&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough,&rdquo; cried Lizabetha Prokofievna abruptly, trembling with anger, &ldquo;we
      have had enough of this balderdash!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a state of terrible excitement she threw back her head, with flaming
      eyes, casting looks of contempt and defiance upon the whole company, in
      which she could no longer distinguish friend from foe. She had restrained
      herself so long that she felt forced to vent her rage on somebody. Those
      who knew Lizabetha Prokofievna saw at once how it was with her. &ldquo;She flies
      into these rages sometimes,&rdquo; said Ivan Fedorovitch to Prince S. the next
      day, &ldquo;but she is not often so violent as she was yesterday; it does not
      happen more than once in three years.&rdquo;

    <p>
      &ldquo;Be quiet, Ivan Fedorovitch! Leave me alone!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Epanchin. &ldquo;Why do
      you offer me your arm now? You had not sense enough to take me away
      before. You are my husband, you are a father, it was your duty to drag me
      away by force, if in my folly I refused to obey you and go quietly. You
      might at least have thought of your daughters. We can find our way out now
      without your help. Here is shame enough for a year! Wait a moment &lsquo;till I
      thank the prince! Thank you, prince, for the entertainment you have given
      us! It was most amusing to hear these young men... It is vile, vile! A
      chaos, a scandal, worse than a nightmare! Is it possible that there can be
      many such people on earth? Be quiet, Aglaya! Be quiet, Alexandra! It is
      none of your business! Don&rsquo;t fuss round me like that, Evgenie Pavlovitch;
      you exasperate me! So, my dear,&rdquo; she cried, addressing the prince, &ldquo;you go
      so far as to beg their pardon! He says, &lsquo;Forgive me for offering you a
      fortune.&rsquo; And you, you mountebank, what are you laughing at?&rdquo; she cried,
      turning suddenly on Lebedeff&rsquo;s nephew. &ldquo;&lsquo;We refuse ten thousand roubles;
      we do not beseech, we demand!&rsquo; As if he did not know that this idiot will
      call on them tomorrow to renew his offers of money and friendship. You
      will, won&rsquo;t you? You will? Come, will you, or won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall,&rdquo; said the prince, with gentle humility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hear him! You count upon it, too,&rdquo; she continued, turning upon
      Doktorenko. &ldquo;You are as sure of him now as if you had the money in your
      pocket. And there you are playing the swaggerer to throw dust in our eyes!
      No, my dear sir, you may take other people in! I can see through all your
      airs and graces, I see your game!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lizabetha Prokofievna!&rdquo; exclaimed the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Lizabetha Prokofievna, it is quite time for us to be going, we will
      take the prince with us,&rdquo; said Prince S. with a smile, in the coolest
      possible way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girls stood apart, almost frightened; their father was positively
      horrified. Mrs. Epanchin&rsquo;s language astonished everybody. Some who stood a
      little way off smiled furtively, and talked in whispers. Lebedeff wore an
      expression of utmost ecstasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chaos and scandal are to be found everywhere, madame,&rdquo; remarked
      Doktorenko, who was considerably put out of countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not like this! Nothing like the spectacle you have just given us, sir,&rdquo;
       answered Lizabetha Prokofievna, with a sort of hysterical rage. &ldquo;Leave me
      alone, will you?&rdquo; she cried violently to those around her, who were trying
      to keep her quiet. &ldquo;No, Evgenie Pavlovitch, if, as you said yourself just
      now, a lawyer said in open court that he found it quite natural that a man
      should murder six people because he was in misery, the world must be
      coming to an end. I had not heard of it before. Now I understand
      everything. And this stutterer, won&rsquo;t he turn out a murderer?&rdquo; she cried,
      pointing to Burdovsky, who was staring at her with stupefaction. &ldquo;I bet he
      will! He will have none of your money, possibly, he will refuse it because
      his conscience will not allow him to accept it, but he will go murdering
      you by night and walking off with your cashbox, with a clear conscience!
      He does not call it a dishonest action but &lsquo;the impulse of a noble
      despair&rsquo;; &lsquo;a negation&rsquo;; or the devil knows what! Bah! everything is upside
      down, everyone walks head downwards. A young girl, brought up at home,
      suddenly jumps into a cab in the middle of the street, saying: &lsquo;Good-bye,
      mother, I married Karlitch, or Ivanitch, the other day!&rsquo; And you think it
      quite right? You call such conduct estimable and natural? The &lsquo;woman
      question&rsquo;? Look here,&rdquo; she continued, pointing to Colia, &ldquo;the other day
      that whippersnapper told me that this was the whole meaning of the &lsquo;woman
      question.&rsquo; But even supposing that your mother is a fool, you are none the
      less, bound to treat her with humanity. Why did you come here tonight so
      insolently? &lsquo;Give us our rights, but don&rsquo;t dare to speak in our presence.
      Show us every mark of deepest respect, while we treat you like the scum of
      the earth.&rsquo; The miscreants have written a tissue of calumny in their
      article, and these are the men who seek for truth, and do battle for the
      right! &lsquo;We do not beseech, we demand, you will get no thanks from us,
      because you will be acting to satisfy your own conscience!&rsquo; What morality!
      But, good heavens! if you declare that the prince&rsquo;s generosity will,
      excite no gratitude in you, he might answer that he is not, bound to be
      grateful to Pavlicheff, who also was only satisfying his own conscience.
      But you counted on the prince&rsquo;s, gratitude towards Pavlicheff; you never
      lent him any money; he owes you nothing; then what were you counting upon
      if not on his gratitude? And if you appeal to that sentiment in others,
      why should you expect to be exempted from it? They are mad! They say
      society is savage and inhuman because it despises a young girl who has
      been seduced. But if you call society inhuman you imply that the young
      girl is made to suffer by its censure. How then, can you hold her up to
      the scorn of society in the newspapers without realizing that you are
      making her suffering, still greater? Madmen! Vain fools! They don&rsquo;t
      believe in God, they don&rsquo;t believe in Christ! But you are so eaten up by
      pride and vanity, that you will end by devouring each other&mdash;that is
      my prophecy! Is not this absurd? Is it not monstrous chaos? And after all
      this, that shameless creature will go and beg their pardon! Are there many
      people like you? What are you smiling at? Because I am not ashamed to
      disgrace myself before you?&mdash;Yes, I am disgraced&mdash;it can&rsquo;t be
      helped now! But don&rsquo;t you jeer at me, you scum!&rdquo; (this was aimed at
      Hippolyte). &ldquo;He is almost at his last gasp, yet he corrupts others. You,
      have got hold of this lad&mdash;&rdquo; (she pointed to Colia); &ldquo;you, have
      turned his head, you have taught him to be an atheist, you don&rsquo;t believe
      in God, and you are not too old to be whipped, sir! A plague upon you! And
      so, Prince Lef Nicolaievitch, you will call on them tomorrow, will you?&rdquo;
       she asked the prince breathlessly, for the second time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I will never speak to you again.&rdquo; She made a sudden movement to go,
      and then turned quickly back. &ldquo;And you will call on that atheist?&rdquo; she
      continued, pointing to Hippolyte. &ldquo;How dare you grin at me like that?&rdquo; she
      shouted furiously, rushing at the invalid, whose mocking smile drove her
      to distraction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Exclamations arose on all sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lizabetha Prokofievna! Lizabetha Prokofievna! Lizabetha Prokofievna!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother, this is disgraceful!&rdquo; cried Aglaya.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Epanchin had approached Hippolyte and seized him firmly by the arm,
      while her eyes, blazing with fury, were fixed upon his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not distress yourself, Aglaya Ivanovitch,&rdquo; he answered calmly; &ldquo;your
      mother knows that one cannot strike a dying man. I am ready to explain why
      I was laughing. I shall be delighted if you will let me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A violent fit of coughing, which lasted a full minute, prevented him from
      finishing his sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is dying, yet he will not stop holding forth!&rdquo; cried Lizabetha
      Prokofievna. She loosed her hold on his arm, almost terrified, as she saw
      him wiping the blood from his lips. &ldquo;Why do you talk? You ought to go home
      to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I will,&rdquo; he whispered hoarsely. &ldquo;As soon as I get home I will go to
      bed at once; and I know I shall be dead in a fortnight; Botkine told me so
      himself last week. That is why I should like to say a few farewell words,
      if you will let me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you must be mad! It is ridiculous! You should take care of yourself;
      what is the use of holding a conversation now? Go home to bed, do!&rdquo; cried
      Mrs. Epanchin in horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I do go to bed I shall never get up again,&rdquo; said Hippolyte, with a
      smile. &ldquo;I meant to take to my bed yesterday and stay there till I died,
      but as my legs can still carry me, I put it off for two days, so as to
      come here with them to-day&mdash;but I am very tired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sit down, sit down, why are you standing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lizabetha Prokofievna placed a chair for him with her own hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said gently. &ldquo;Sit opposite to me, and let us talk. We must
      have a talk now, Lizabetha Prokofievna; I am very anxious for it.&rdquo; He
      smiled at her once more. &ldquo;Remember that today, for the last time, I am out
      in the air, and in the company of my fellow-men, and that in a fortnight I
      shall certainly be no longer in this world. So, in a way, this is my
      farewell to nature and to men. I am not very sentimental, but do you know,
      I am quite glad that all this has happened at Pavlofsk, where at least one
      can see a green tree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why talk now?&rdquo; replied Lizabetha Prokofievna, more and more alarmed;
      &ldquo;You are quite feverish. Just now you would not stop shouting, and now you can
      hardly breathe. You are gasping.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall have time to rest. Why will you not grant my last wish? Do you
      know, Lizabetha Prokofievna, that I have dreamed of meeting you for a long
      while? I had often heard of you from Colia; he is almost the only person
      who still comes to see me. You are an original and eccentric woman; I have
      seen that for myself&mdash;Do you know, I have even been rather fond of
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens! And I very nearly struck him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were prevented by Aglaya Ivanovna. I think I am not mistaken? That is
      your daughter, Aglaya Ivanovna? She is so beautiful that I recognized her
      directly, although I had never seen her before. Let me, at least, look on
      beauty for the last time in my life,&rdquo; he said with a wry smile. &ldquo;You are
      here with the prince, and your husband, and a large company. Why should
      you refuse to gratify my last wish?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me a chair!&rdquo; cried Lizabetha Prokofievna, but she seized one for
      herself and sat down opposite to Hippolyte. &ldquo;Colia, you must go home with
      him,&rdquo; she commanded, &ldquo;and tomorrow I will come my self.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you let me ask the prince for a cup of tea?... I am exhausted. Do
      you know what you might do, Lizabetha Prokofievna? I think you wanted to
      take the prince home with you for tea. Stay here, and let us spend the
      evening together. I am sure the prince will give us all some tea. Forgive
      me for being so free and easy&mdash;but I know you are kind, and the
      prince is kind, too. In fact, we are all good-natured people&mdash;it is
      really quite comical.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince bestirred himself to give orders. Lebedeff hurried out,
      followed by Vera.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is quite true,&rdquo; said Mrs. Epanchin decisively. &ldquo;Talk, but not too
      loud, and don&rsquo;t excite yourself. You have made me sorry for you. Prince,
      you don&rsquo;t deserve that I should stay and have tea with you, yet I will,
      all the same, but I won&rsquo;t apologize. I apologize to nobody! Nobody! It is
      absurd! However, forgive me, prince, if I blew you up&mdash;that is, if
      you like, of course. But please don&rsquo;t let me keep anyone,&rdquo; she added
      suddenly to her husband and daughters, in a tone of resentment, as though
      they had grievously offended her. &ldquo;I can come home alone quite well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But they did not let her finish, and gathered round her eagerly. The
      prince immediately invited everyone to stay for tea, and apologized for
      not having thought of it before. The general murmured a few polite words,
      and asked Lizabetha Prokofievna if she did not feel cold on the terrace.
      He very nearly asked Hippolyte how long he had been at the University, but
      stopped himself in time. Evgenie Pavlovitch and Prince S. suddenly grew
      extremely gay and amiable. Adelaida and Alexandra had not recovered from
      their surprise, but it was now mingled with satisfaction; in short,
      everyone seemed very much relieved that Lizabetha Prokofievna had got over
      her paroxysm. Aglaya alone still frowned, and sat apart in silence. All
      the other guests stayed on as well; no one wanted to go, not even General
      Ivolgin, but Lebedeff said something to him in passing which did not seem
      to please him, for he immediately went and sulked in a corner. The prince
      took care to offer tea to Burdovsky and his friends as well as the rest.
      The invitation made them rather uncomfortable. They muttered that they
      would wait for Hippolyte, and went and sat by themselves in a distant
      corner of the verandah. Tea was served at once; Lebedeff had no doubt
      ordered it for himself and his family before the others arrived. It was
      striking eleven.
    </p>
    <h3>
      X.
    </h3>
    <p>
      After moistening his lips with the tea which Vera Lebedeff brought him,
      Hippolyte set the cup down on the table, and glanced round. He seemed
      confused and almost at a loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just look, Lizabetha Prokofievna,&rdquo; he began, with a kind of feverish
      haste; &ldquo;these china cups are supposed to be extremely valuable. Lebedeff
      always keeps them locked up in his china-cupboard; they were part of his
      wife&rsquo;s dowry. Yet he has brought them out tonight&mdash;in your honour, of
      course! He is so pleased&mdash;&rdquo; He was about to add something else, but
      could not find the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, he is feeling embarrassed; I expected as much,&rdquo; whispered Evgenie
      Pavlovitch suddenly in the prince&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;It is a bad sign; what do you
      think? Now, out of spite, he will come out with something so outrageous
      that even Lizabetha Prokofievna will not be able to stand it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Muishkin looked at him inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not care if he does?&rdquo; added Evgenie Pavlovitch. &ldquo;Neither do I; in
      fact, I should be glad, merely as a proper punishment for our dear
      Lizabetha Prokofievna. I am very anxious that she should get it, without
      delay, and I shall stay till she does. You seem feverish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind; by-and-by; yes, I am not feeling well,&rdquo; said the prince
      impatiently, hardly listening. He had just heard Hippolyte mention his own
      name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t believe it?&rdquo; said the invalid, with a nervous laugh. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      wonder, but the prince will have no difficulty in believing it; he will
      not be at all surprised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you hear, prince&mdash;do you hear that?&rdquo; said Lizabetha Prokofievna,
      turning towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was laughter in the group around her, and Lebedeff stood before her
      gesticulating wildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He declares that your humbug of a landlord revised this gentleman&rsquo;s
      article&mdash;the article that was read aloud just now&mdash;in which you
      got such a charming dressing-down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince regarded Lebedeff with astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you say something?&rdquo; cried Lizabetha Prokofievna, stamping her
      foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; murmured the prince, with his eyes still fixed on Lebedeff, &ldquo;I can
      see now that he did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it true?&rdquo; she asked eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely, your excellency,&rdquo; said Lebedeff, without the least
      hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Epanchin almost sprang up in amazement at his answer, and at the
      assurance of his tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He actually seems to boast of it!&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am base&mdash;base!&rdquo; muttered Lebedeff, beating his breast, and hanging
      his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do I care if you are base or not? He thinks he has only to say, &lsquo;I
      am base,&rsquo; and there is an end of it. As to you, prince, are you not
      ashamed?&mdash;I repeat, are you not ashamed, to mix with such riff-raff?
      I will never forgive you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The prince will forgive me!&rdquo; said Lebedeff with emotional conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keller suddenly left his seat, and approached Lizabetha Prokofievna.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was only out of generosity, madame,&rdquo; he said in a resonant voice, &ldquo;and
      because I would not betray a friend in an awkward position, that I did not
      mention this revision before; though you heard him yourself threatening to
      kick us down the steps. To clear the matter up, I declare now that I did
      have recourse to his assistance, and that I paid him six roubles for it.
      But I did not ask him to correct my style; I simply went to him for
      information concerning the facts, of which I was ignorant to a great
      extent, and which he was competent to give. The story of the gaiters, the
      appetite in the Swiss professor&rsquo;s house, the substitution of fifty roubles
      for two hundred and fifty&mdash;all such details, in fact, were got from
      him. I paid him six roubles for them; but he did not correct the style.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must state that I only revised the first part of the article,&rdquo;
       interposed Lebedeff with feverish impatience, while laughter rose from all
      around him; &ldquo;but we fell out in the middle over one idea, so I never
      corrected the second part. Therefore I cannot be held responsible for the
      numerous grammatical blunders in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all he thinks of!&rdquo; cried Lizabetha Prokofievna.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask when this article was revised?&rdquo; said Evgenie Pavlovitch to
      Keller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yesterday morning,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;we had an interview which we all gave
      our word of honour to keep secret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The very time when he was cringing before you and making protestations of
      devotion! Oh, the mean wretches! I will have nothing to do with your
      Pushkin, and your daughter shall not set foot in my house!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lizabetha Prokofievna was about to rise, when she saw Hippolyte laughing,
      and turned upon him with irritation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, I suppose you wanted to make me look ridiculous?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven forbid!&rdquo; he answered, with a forced smile. &ldquo;But I am more than
      ever struck by your eccentricity, Lizabetha Prokofievna. I admit that I
      told you of Lebedeff&rsquo;s duplicity, on purpose. I knew the effect it would
      have on you,&mdash;on you alone, for the prince will forgive him. He has
      probably forgiven him already, and is racking his brains to find some
      excuse for him&mdash;is not that the truth, prince?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gasped as he spoke, and his strange agitation seemed to increase.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Mrs. Epanchin angrily, surprised at his tone; &ldquo;well, what
      more?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard many things of the kind about you...they delighted me... I
      have learned to hold you in the highest esteem,&rdquo; continued Hippolyte.
    </p>
    <p>
      His words seemed tinged with a kind of sarcastic mockery, yet he was
      extremely agitated, casting suspicious glances around him, growing
      confused, and constantly losing the thread of his ideas. All this,
      together with his consumptive appearance, and the frenzied expression of
      his blazing eyes, naturally attracted the attention of everyone present.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might have been surprised (though I admit I know nothing of the world),
      not only that you should have stayed on just now in the company of such
      people as myself and my friends, who are not of your class, but that you
      should let these... young ladies listen to such a scandalous affair,
      though no doubt novel-reading has taught them all there is to know. I may
      be mistaken; I hardly know what I am saying; but surely no one but you
      would have stayed to please a whippersnapper (yes, a whippersnapper; I
      admit it) to spend the evening and take part in everything&mdash;only to
      be ashamed of it tomorrow. (I know I express myself badly.) I admire and
      appreciate it all extremely, though the expression on the face of his
      excellency, your husband, shows that he thinks it very improper. He-he!&rdquo;
       He burst out laughing, and was seized with a fit of coughing which lasted
      for two minutes and prevented him from speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has lost his breath now!&rdquo; said Lizabetha Prokofievna coldly, looking
      at him with more curiosity than pity: &ldquo;Come, my dear boy, that is quite
      enough&mdash;let us make an end of this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ivan Fedorovitch, now quite out of patience, interrupted suddenly. &ldquo;Let me
      remark in my turn, sir,&rdquo; he said in tones of deep annoyance, &ldquo;that my wife
      is here as the guest of Prince Lef Nicolaievitch, our friend and
      neighbour, and that in any case, young man, it is not for you to pass
      judgment on the conduct of Lizabetha Prokofievna, or to make remarks aloud
      in my presence concerning what feelings you think may be read in my face.
      Yes, my wife stayed here,&rdquo; continued the general, with increasing
      irritation, &ldquo;more out of amazement than anything else. Everyone can
      understand that a collection of such strange young men would attract the
      attention of a person interested in contemporary life. I stayed myself,
      just as I sometimes stop to look on in the street when I see something
      that may be regarded as-as-as-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a curiosity,&rdquo; suggested Evgenie Pavlovitch, seeing his excellency
      involved in a comparison which he could not complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is exactly the word I wanted,&rdquo; said the general with satisfaction&mdash;&ldquo;a
      curiosity. However, the most astonishing and, if I may so express myself,
      the most painful, thing in this matter, is that you cannot even
      understand, young man, that Lizabetha Prokofievna, only stayed with you
      because you are ill,&mdash;if you really are dying&mdash;moved by the pity
      awakened by your plaintive appeal, and that her name, character, and
      social position place her above all risk of contamination. Lizabetha
      Prokofievna!&rdquo; he continued, now crimson with rage, &ldquo;if you are coming, we
      will say goodnight to the prince, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you for the lesson, general,&rdquo; said Hippolyte, with unexpected
      gravity, regarding him thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two minutes more, if you please, dear Ivan Fedorovitch,&rdquo; said Lizabetha
      Prokofievna to her husband; &ldquo;it seems to me that he is in a fever and
      delirious; you can see by his eyes what a state he is in; it is impossible
      to let him go back to Petersburg tonight. Can you put him up, Lef
      Nicolaievitch? I hope you are not bored, dear prince,&rdquo; she added suddenly
      to Prince S. &ldquo;Alexandra, my dear, come here! Your hair is coming down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She arranged her daughter&rsquo;s hair, which was not in the least disordered,
      and gave her a kiss. This was all that she had called her for.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you were capable of development,&rdquo; said Hippolyte, coming out of
      his fit of abstraction. &ldquo;Yes, that is what I meant to say,&rdquo; he added, with
      the satisfaction of one who suddenly remembers something he had forgotten.
      &ldquo;Here is Burdovsky, sincerely anxious to protect his mother; is not that
      so? And he himself is the cause of her disgrace. The prince is anxious to
      help Burdovsky and offers him friendship and a large sum of money, in the
      sincerity of his heart. And here they stand like two sworn enemies&mdash;ha,
      ha, ha! You all hate Burdovsky because his behaviour with regard to his
      mother is shocking and repugnant to you; do you not? Is not that true? Is
      it not true? You all have a passion for beauty and distinction in outward
      forms; that is all you care for, isn&rsquo;t it? I have suspected for a long
      time that you cared for nothing else! Well, let me tell you that perhaps
      there is not one of you who loved your mother as Burdovsky loved his. As
      to you, prince, I know that you have sent money secretly to Burdovsky&rsquo;s
      mother through Gania. Well, I bet now,&rdquo; he continued with an hysterical
      laugh, &ldquo;that Burdovsky will accuse you of indelicacy, and reproach you
      with a want of respect for his mother! Yes, that is quite certain! Ha, ha,
      ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He caught his breath, and began to cough once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, that is enough! That is all now; you have no more to say? Now go to
      bed; you are burning with fever,&rdquo; said Lizabetha Prokofievna impatiently.
      Her anxious eyes had never left the invalid. &ldquo;Good heavens, he is going to
      begin again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are laughing, I think? Why do you keep laughing at me?&rdquo; said
      Hippolyte irritably to Evgenie Pavlovitch, who certainly was laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only want to know, Mr. Hippolyte&mdash;excuse me, I forget your
      surname.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Terentieff,&rdquo; said the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, Mr. Terentieff. Thank you prince. I heard it just now, but had
      forgotten it. I want to know, Mr. Terentieff, if what I have heard about
      you is true. It seems you are convinced that if you could speak to the
      people from a window for a quarter of an hour, you could make them all
      adopt your views and follow you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may have said so,&rdquo; answered Hippolyte, as if trying to remember. &ldquo;Yes,
      I certainly said so,&rdquo; he continued with sudden animation, fixing an
      unflinching glance on his questioner. &ldquo;What of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing. I was only seeking further information, to put the finishing
      touch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Evgenie Pavlovitch was silent, but Hippolyte kept his eyes fixed upon him,
      waiting impatiently for more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, have you finished?&rdquo; said Lizabetha Prokofievna to Evgenie. &ldquo;Make
      haste, sir; it is time he went to bed. Have you more to say?&rdquo; She was very
      angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have a little more,&rdquo; said Evgenie Pavlovitch, with a smile. &ldquo;It
      seems to me that all you and your friends have said, Mr. Terentieff, and
      all you have just put forward with such undeniable talent, may be summed
      up in the triumph of right above all, independent of everything else, to
      the exclusion of everything else; perhaps even before having discovered
      what constitutes the right. I may be mistaken?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are certainly mistaken; I do not even understand you. What else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Murmurs arose in the neighbourhood of Burdovsky and his companions;
      Lebedeff&rsquo;s nephew protested under his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have nearly finished,&rdquo; replied Evgenie Pavlovitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will only remark that from these premises one could conclude that might
      is right&mdash;I mean the right of the clenched fist, and of personal
      inclination. Indeed, the world has often come to that conclusion. Prudhon
      upheld that might is right. In the American War some of the most advanced
      Liberals took sides with the planters on the score that the blacks were an
      inferior race to the whites, and that might was the right of the white
      race.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean, no doubt, that you do not deny that might is right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are at least logical. I would only point out that from the right of
      might, to the right of tigers and crocodiles, or even Daniloff and Gorsky,
      is but a step.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing about that; what else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hippolyte was scarcely listening. He kept saying &ldquo;well?&rdquo; and &ldquo;what else?&rdquo;
       mechanically, without the least curiosity, and by mere force of habit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, nothing else; that is all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However, I bear you no grudge,&rdquo; said Hippolyte suddenly, and, hardly
      conscious of what he was doing, he held out his hand with a smile. The
      gesture took Evgenie Pavlovitch by surprise, but with the utmost gravity
      he touched the hand that was offered him in token of forgiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can but thank you,&rdquo; he said, in a tone too respectful to be sincere,
      &ldquo;for your kindness in letting me speak, for I have often noticed that our
      Liberals never allow other people to have an opinion of their own, and
      immediately answer their opponents with abuse, if they do not have
      recourse to arguments of a still more unpleasant nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you say is quite true,&rdquo; observed General Epanchin; then, clasping
      his hands behind his back, he returned to his place on the terrace steps,
      where he yawned with an air of boredom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, sir, that will do; you weary me,&rdquo; said Lizabetha Prokofievna
      suddenly to Evgenie Pavlovitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hippolyte rose all at once, looking troubled and almost frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is time for me to go,&rdquo; he said, glancing round in perplexity. &ldquo;I have
      detained you... I wanted to tell you everything... I thought you all...
      for the last time... it was a whim...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He evidently had sudden fits of returning animation, when he awoke from
      his semi-delirium; then, recovering full self-possession for a few
      moments, he would speak, in disconnected phrases which had perhaps haunted
      him for a long while on his bed of suffering, during weary, sleepless
      nights.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, good-bye,&rdquo; he said abruptly. &ldquo;You think it is easy for me to say
      good-bye to you? Ha, ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Feeling that his question was somewhat gauche, he smiled angrily. Then as
      if vexed that he could not ever express what he really meant, he said
      irritably, in a loud voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellency, I have the honour of inviting you to my funeral; that is, if
      you will deign to honour it with your presence. I invite you all,
      gentlemen, as well as the general.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He burst out laughing again, but it was the laughter of a madman.
      Lizabetha Prokofievna approached him anxiously and seized his arm. He
      stared at her for a moment, still laughing, but soon his face grew
      serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know that I came here to see those trees?&rdquo; pointing to the trees
      in the park. &ldquo;It is not ridiculous, is it? Say that it is not ridiculous!&rdquo;
       he demanded urgently of Lizabetha Prokofievna. Then he seemed to be
      plunged in thought. A moment later he raised his head, and his eyes sought
      for someone. He was looking for Evgenie Pavlovitch, who was close by on
      his right as before, but he had forgotten this, and his eyes ranged over
      the assembled company. &ldquo;Ah! you have not gone!&rdquo; he said, when he caught
      sight of him at last. &ldquo;You kept on laughing just now, because I thought of
      speaking to the people from the window for a quarter of an hour. But I am
      not eighteen, you know; lying on that bed, and looking out of that window,
      I have thought of all sorts of things for such a long time that... a dead
      man has no age, you know. I was saying that to myself only last week, when
      I was awake in the night. Do you know what you fear most? You fear our
      sincerity more than anything, although you despise us! The idea crossed my
      mind that night... You thought I was making fun of you just now, Lizabetha
      Prokofievna? No, the idea of mockery was far from me; I only meant to
      praise you. Colia told me the prince called you a child&mdash;very well&mdash;but
      let me see, I had something else to say...&rdquo; He covered his face with his
      hands and tried to collect his thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes&mdash;you were going away just now, and I thought to myself: &lsquo;I
      shall never see these people again&mdash;never again! This is the last time I
      shall see the trees, too. I shall see nothing after this but the red brick
      wall of Meyer&rsquo;s house opposite my window. Tell them about it&mdash;try to
      tell them,&rsquo; I thought. &lsquo;Here is a beautiful young girl&mdash;you are a
      dead man; make them understand that. Tell them that a dead man may say
      anything&mdash;and Mrs. Grundy will not be angry&mdash;ha-ha! You are not
      laughing?&rdquo; He looked anxiously around. &ldquo;But you know I get so many queer
      ideas, lying there in bed. I have grown convinced that nature is full of
      mockery&mdash;you called me an atheist just now, but you know this
      nature... why are you laughing again? You are very cruel!&rdquo; he added
      suddenly, regarding them all with mournful reproach. &ldquo;I have not corrupted
      Colia,&rdquo; he concluded in a different and very serious tone, as if
      remembering something again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody here is laughing at you. Calm yourself,&rdquo; said Lizabetha
      Prokofievna, much moved. &ldquo;You shall see a new doctor tomorrow; the other
      was mistaken; but sit down, do not stand like that! You are delirious&mdash;&rdquo;
       Oh, what shall we do with him she cried in anguish, as she made him sit
      down again in the arm-chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      A tear glistened on her cheek. At the sight of it Hippolyte seemed amazed.
      He lifted his hand timidly and, touched the tear with his finger, smiling
      like a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I... you,&rdquo; he began joyfully. &ldquo;You cannot tell how I... he always spoke
      so enthusiastically of you, Colia here; I liked his enthusiasm. I was not
      corrupting him! But I must leave him, too&mdash;I wanted to leave them all&mdash;there
      was not one of them&mdash;not one! I wanted to be a man of action&mdash;I
      had a right to be. Oh! what a lot of things I wanted! Now I want nothing;
      I renounce all my wants; I swore to myself that I would want nothing; let
      them seek the truth without me! Yes, nature is full of mockery! Why&rdquo;&mdash;he
      continued with sudden warmth&mdash;&ldquo;does she create the choicest beings
      only to mock at them? The only human being who is recognized as perfect,
      when nature showed him to mankind, was given the mission to say things
      which have caused the shedding of so much blood that it would have drowned
      mankind if it had all been shed at once! Oh! it is better for me to die! I
      should tell some dreadful lie too; nature would so contrive it! I have
      corrupted nobody. I wanted to live for the happiness of all men, to find
      and spread the truth. I used to look out of my window at the wall of
      Meyer&rsquo;s house, and say to myself that if I could speak for a quarter of an
      hour I would convince the whole world, and now for once in my life I have
      come into contact with... you&mdash;if not with the others! And what is
      the result? Nothing! The sole result is that you despise me! Therefore I
      must be a fool, I am useless, it is time I disappeared! And I shall leave
      not even a memory! Not a sound, not a trace, not a single deed! I have not
      spread a single truth!... Do not laugh at the fool! Forget him! Forget him
      forever! I beseech you, do not be so cruel as to remember! Do you know
      that if I were not consumptive, I would kill myself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Though he seemed to wish to say much more, he became silent. He fell back
      into his chair, and, covering his face with his hands, began to sob like a
      little child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! what on earth are we to do with him?&rdquo; cried Lizabetha Prokofievna.
      She hastened to him and pressed his head against her bosom, while he
      sobbed convulsively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, come! There, you must not cry, that will do. You are a good
      child! God will forgive you, because you knew no better. Come now, be a
      man! You know presently you will be ashamed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hippolyte raised his head with an effort, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have little brothers and sisters, over there, poor avid innocent. She
      will corrupt them! You are a saint! You are a child yourself&mdash;save
      them! Snatch them from that... she is... it is shameful! Oh! help them!
      God will repay you a hundredfold. For the love of God, for the love of
      Christ!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak, Ivan Fedorovitch! What are we to do?&rdquo; cried Lizabetha Prokofievna,
      irritably. &ldquo;Please break your majestic silence! I tell you, if you cannot
      come to some decision, I will stay here all night myself. You have
      tyrannized over me enough, you autocrat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spoke angrily, and in great excitement, and expected an immediate
      reply. But in such a case, no matter how many are present, all prefer to
      keep silence: no one will take the initiative, but all reserve their
      comments till afterwards. There were some present&mdash;Varvara
      Ardalionovna, for instance&mdash;who would have willingly sat there till
      morning without saying a word. Varvara had sat apart all the evening
      without opening her lips, but she listened to everything with the closest
      attention; perhaps she had her reasons for so doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said the general, &ldquo;it seems to me that a sick-nurse would be of
      more use here than an excitable person like you. Perhaps it would be as
      well to get some sober, reliable man for the night. In any case we must
      consult the prince, and leave the patient to rest at once. Tomorrow we can
      see what can be done for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is nearly midnight; we are going. Will he come with us, or is he to
      stay here?&rdquo; Doktorenko asked crossly of the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can stay with him if you like,&rdquo; said Muishkin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is plenty of room here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, to the astonishment of all, Keller went quickly up to the
      general.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellency,&rdquo; he said, impulsively, &ldquo;if you want a reliable man for the
      night, I am ready to sacrifice myself for my friend&mdash;such a soul as
      he has! I have long thought him a great man, excellency! My article showed
      my lack of education, but when he criticizes he scatters pearls!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ivan Fedorovitch turned from the boxer with a gesture of despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be delighted if he will stay; it would certainly be difficult for
      him to get back to Petersburg,&rdquo; said the prince, in answer to the eager
      questions of Lizabetha Prokofievna.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are half asleep, are you not? If you don&rsquo;t want him, I will take
      him back to my house! Why, good gracious! He can hardly stand up himself!
      What is it? Are you ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not finding the prince on his death-bed, Lizabetha Prokofievna had been
      misled by his appearance to think him much better than he was. But his
      recent illness, the painful memories attached to it, the fatigue of this
      evening, the incident with &ldquo;Pavlicheff&rsquo;s son,&rdquo; and now this scene with
      Hippolyte, had all so worked on his oversensitive nature that he was now
      almost in a fever. Moreover, a new trouble, almost a fear, showed itself in
      his eyes; he watched Hippolyte anxiously as if expecting something
      further.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Hippolyte arose. His face, shockingly pale, was that of a man
      overwhelmed with shame and despair. This was shown chiefly in the look of
      fear and hatred which he cast upon the assembled company, and in the wild
      smile upon his trembling lips. Then he cast down his eyes, and with the
      same smile, staggered towards Burdovsky and Doktorenko, who stood at the
      entrance to the verandah. He had decided to go with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There! that is what I feared!&rdquo; cried the prince. &ldquo;It was inevitable!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hippolyte turned upon him, a prey to maniacal rage, which set all the
      muscles of his face quivering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! that is what you feared! It was inevitable, you say! Well, let me
      tell you that if I hate anyone here&mdash;I hate you all,&rdquo; he cried, in a
      hoarse, strained voice&mdash;&ldquo;but you, you, with your jesuitical soul,
      your soul of sickly sweetness, idiot, beneficent millionaire&mdash;I hate
      you worse than anything or anyone on earth! I saw through you and hated
      you long ago; from the day I first heard of you. I hated you with my whole
      heart. You have contrived all this! You have driven me into this state!
      You have made a dying man disgrace himself. You, you, you are the cause of
      my abject cowardice! I would kill you if I remained alive! I do not want
      your benefits; I will accept none from anyone; do you hear? Not from any
      one! I want nothing! I was delirious, do not dare to triumph! I curse
      every one of you, once for all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Breath failed him here, and he was obliged to stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is ashamed of his tears!&rdquo; whispered Lebedeff to Lizabetha Prokofievna.
      &ldquo;It was inevitable. Ah! what a wonderful man the prince is! He read his
      very soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Epanchin would not deign to look at Lebedeff. Drawn up haughtily,
      with her head held high, she gazed at the &ldquo;riff-raff,&rdquo; with scornful
      curiosity. When Hippolyte had finished, Ivan Fedorovitch shrugged his
      shoulders, and his wife looked him angrily up and down, as if to demand
      the meaning of his movement. Then she turned to the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, prince, many thanks, eccentric friend of the family, for the
      pleasant evening you have provided for us. I am sure you are quite pleased
      that you have managed to mix us up with your extraordinary affairs. It is
      quite enough, dear family friend; thank you for giving us an opportunity
      of getting to know you so well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She arranged her cloak with hands that trembled with anger as she waited
      for the &ldquo;riff-raff&rdquo; to go. The cab which Lebedeff&rsquo;s son had gone to fetch
      a quarter of an hour ago, by Doktorenko&rsquo;s order, arrived at that moment.
      The general thought fit to put in a word after his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, prince, I hardly expected after&mdash;after all our friendly
      intercourse&mdash;and you see, Lizabetha Prokofievna&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa, how can you?&rdquo; cried Adelaida, walking quickly up to the prince and
      holding out her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled absently at her; then suddenly he felt a burning sensation in
      his ear as an angry voice whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you do not turn those dreadful people out of the house this very
      instant, I shall hate you all my life&mdash;all my life!&rdquo; It was Aglaya.
      She seemed almost in a frenzy, but she turned away before the prince could
      look at her. However, there was no one left to turn out of the house, for
      they had managed meanwhile to get Hippolyte into the cab, and it had
      driven off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, how much longer is this going to last, Ivan Fedorovitch? What do
      you think? Shall I soon be delivered from these odious youths?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, I am quite ready; naturally... the prince.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ivan Fedorovitch held out his hand to Muishkin, but ran after his wife,
      who was leaving with every sign of violent indignation, before he had time
      to shake it. Adelaida, her fiance, and Alexandra, said good-bye to their
      host with sincere friendliness. Evgenie Pavlovitch did the same, and he
      alone seemed in good spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I expected has happened! But I am sorry, you poor fellow, that you
      should have had to suffer for it,&rdquo; he murmured, with a most charming
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aglaya left without saying good-bye. But the evening was not to end
      without a last adventure. An unexpected meeting was yet in store for
      Lizabetha Prokofievna.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had scarcely descended the terrace steps leading to the high road that
      skirts the park at Pavlofsk, when suddenly there dashed by a smart open
      carriage, drawn by a pair of beautiful white horses. Having passed some
      ten yards beyond the house, the carriage suddenly drew up, and one of the
      two ladies seated in it turned sharp round as though she had just caught
      sight of some acquaintance whom she particularly wished to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Evgenie Pavlovitch! Is that you?&rdquo; cried a clear, sweet voice, which
      caused the prince, and perhaps someone else, to tremble. &ldquo;Well, I <i>am</i>
      glad I&rsquo;ve found you at last! I&rsquo;ve sent to town for you twice today myself!
      My messengers have been searching for you everywhere!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Evgenie Pavlovitch stood on the steps like one struck by lightning. Mrs.
      Epanchin stood still too, but not with the petrified expression of
      Evgenie. She gazed haughtily at the audacious person who had addressed her
      companion, and then turned a look of astonishment upon Evgenie himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s news!&rdquo; continued the clear voice. &ldquo;You need not be anxious about
      Kupferof&rsquo;s IOU&rsquo;s&mdash;Rogojin has bought them up. I persuaded him to!&mdash;I
      dare say we shall settle Biscup too, so it&rsquo;s all right, you see! <i>Au
      revoir</i>, tomorrow! And don&rsquo;t worry!&rdquo; The carriage moved on, and
      disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The woman&rsquo;s mad!&rdquo; cried Evgenie, at last, crimson with anger, and looking
      confusedly around. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what she&rsquo;s talking about! What IOU&rsquo;s? Who
      is she?&rdquo; Mrs. Epanchin continued to watch his face for a couple of
      seconds; then she marched briskly and haughtily away towards her own
      house, the rest following her.
    </p>
    <p>
      A minute afterwards, Evgenie Pavlovitch reappeared on the terrace, in
      great agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prince,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;tell me the truth; do you know what all this means?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing whatever about it!&rdquo; replied the latter, who was, himself,
      in a state of nervous excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, nor do I!&rdquo; said Evgenie Pavlovitch, laughing suddenly. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t
      the slightest knowledge of any such IOU&rsquo;s as she mentioned, I swear I
      haven&rsquo;t&mdash;What&rsquo;s the matter, are you fainting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no&mdash;no&mdash;I&rsquo;m all right, I assure you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <h3>
      XI.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The anger of the Epanchin family was unappeased for three days. As usual
      the prince reproached himself, and had expected punishment, but he was
      inwardly convinced that Lizabetha Prokofievna could not be seriously angry
      with him, and that she probably was more angry with herself. He was
      painfully surprised, therefore, when three days passed with no word from
      her. Other things also troubled and perplexed him, and one of these grew
      more important in his eyes as the days went by. He had begun to blame
      himself for two opposite tendencies&mdash;on the one hand to extreme,
      almost &ldquo;senseless,&rdquo; confidence in his fellows, on the other to a &ldquo;vile,
      gloomy suspiciousness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By the end of the third day the incident of the eccentric lady and Evgenie
      Pavlovitch had attained enormous and mysterious proportions in his mind.
      He sorrowfully asked himself whether he had been the cause of this new
      &ldquo;monstrosity,&rdquo; or was it... but he refrained from saying who else might be
      in fault. As for the letters N.P.B., he looked on that as a harmless joke,
      a mere childish piece of mischief&mdash;so childish that he felt it would
      be shameful, almost dishonourable, to attach any importance to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day after these scandalous events, however, the prince had the honour
      of receiving a visit from Adelaida and her fiance, Prince S. They came,
      ostensibly, to inquire after his health. They had wandered out for a walk,
      and called in &ldquo;by accident,&rdquo; and talked for almost the whole of the time
      they were with him about a certain most lovely tree in the park, which
      Adelaida had set her heart upon for a picture. This, and a little amiable
      conversation on Prince S.&rsquo;s part, occupied the time, and not a word was
      said about last evening&rsquo;s episodes. At length Adelaida burst out laughing,
      apologized, and explained that they had come incognito; from which, and
      from the circumstance that they said nothing about the prince&rsquo;s either
      walking back with them or coming to see them later on, the latter inferred
      that he was in Mrs. Epanchin&rsquo;s black books. Adelaida mentioned a
      watercolour that she would much like to show him, and explained that she
      would either send it by Colia, or bring it herself the next day&mdash;which
      to the prince seemed very suggestive.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, however, just as the visitors were on the point of departing,
      Prince S. seemed suddenly to recollect himself. &ldquo;Oh yes, by-the-by,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;do you happen to know, my dear Lef Nicolaievitch, who that lady was
      who called out to Evgenie Pavlovitch last night, from the carriage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was Nastasia Philipovna,&rdquo; said the prince; &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t you know that? I
      cannot tell you who her companion was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what on earth did she mean? I assure you it is a real riddle to me&mdash;to
      me, and to others, too!&rdquo; Prince S. seemed to be under the influence of
      sincere astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She spoke of some bills of Evgenie Pavlovitch&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said the prince,
      simply, &ldquo;which Rogojin had bought up from someone; and implied that
      Rogojin would not press him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I heard that much, my dear fellow! But the thing is so impossibly
      absurd! A man of property like Evgenie to give IOU&rsquo;s to a money-lender,
      and to be worried about them! It is ridiculous. Besides, he cannot
      possibly be on such intimate terms with Nastasia Philipovna as she gave us
      to understand; that&rsquo;s the principal part of the mystery! He has given me
      his word that he knows nothing whatever about the matter, and of course I
      believe him. Well, the question is, my dear prince, do you know anything
      about it? Has any sort of suspicion of the meaning of it come across you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I know nothing whatever about it. I assure you I had nothing at all
      to do with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, prince, how strange you have become! I assure you, I hardly know you
      for your old self. How can you suppose that I ever suggested you could
      have had a finger in such a business? But you are not quite yourself
      today, I can see.&rdquo; He embraced the prince, and kissed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean, though,&rdquo; asked Muishkin, &ldquo;&lsquo;by such a business&rsquo;? I don&rsquo;t
      see any particular &lsquo;business&rsquo; about it at all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, undoubtedly, this person wished somehow, and for some reason, to do
      Evgenie Pavlovitch a bad turn, by attributing to him&mdash;before
      witnesses&mdash;qualities which he neither has nor can have,&rdquo; replied
      Prince S. drily enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Muiskhin looked disturbed, but continued to gaze intently and
      questioningly into Prince S.&rsquo;s face. The latter, however, remained silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it was not simply a matter of bills?&rdquo; Muishkin said at last, with
      some impatience. &ldquo;It was not as she said?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I ask you, my dear sir, how can there be anything in common between
      Evgenie Pavlovitch, and&mdash;her, and again Rogojin? I tell you he is a
      man of immense wealth&mdash;as I know for a fact; and he has further
      expectations from his uncle. Simply Nastasia Philipovna&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Prince S. paused, as though unwilling to continue talking about Nastasia
      Philipovna.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then at all events he knows her!&rdquo; remarked the prince, after a moment&rsquo;s
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that may be. He may have known her some time ago&mdash;two or three
      years, at least. He used to know Totski. But it is impossible that there
      should be any intimacy between them. She has not even been in the place&mdash;many
      people don&rsquo;t even know that she has returned from Moscow! I have only
      observed her carriage about for the last three days or so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lovely carriage,&rdquo; said Adelaida.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it was a beautiful turn-out, certainly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The visitors left the house, however, on no less friendly terms than
      before. But the visit was of the greatest importance to the prince, from
      his own point of view. Admitting that he had his suspicions, from the
      moment of the occurrence of last night, perhaps even before, that Nastasia
      had some mysterious end in view, yet this visit confirmed his suspicions
      and justified his fears. It was all clear to him; Prince S. was wrong,
      perhaps, in his view of the matter, but he was somewhere near the truth,
      and was right in so far as that he understood there to be an intrigue of
      some sort going on. Perhaps Prince S. saw it all more clearly than he had
      allowed his hearers to understand. At all events, nothing could be plainer
      than that he and Adelaida had come for the express purpose of obtaining
      explanations, and that they suspected him of being concerned in the
      affair. And if all this were so, then <i>she</i> must have some terrible
      object in view! What was it? There was no stopping <i>her</i>, as Muishkin
      knew from experience, in the performance of anything she had set her mind
      on! &ldquo;Oh, she is mad, mad!&rdquo; thought the poor prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there were many other puzzling occurrences that day, which required
      immediate explanation, and the prince felt very sad. A visit from Vera
      Lebedeff distracted him a little. She brought the infant Lubotchka with
      her as usual, and talked cheerfully for some time. Then came her younger
      sister, and later the brother, who attended a school close by. He informed
      Muishkin that his father had lately found a new interpretation of the star
      called &ldquo;wormwood,&rdquo; which fell upon the water-springs, as described in the
      Apocalypse. He had decided that it meant the network of railroads spread
      over the face of Europe at the present time. The prince refused to believe
      that Lebedeff could have given such an interpretation, and they decided to
      ask him about it at the earliest opportunity. Vera related how Keller had
      taken up his abode with them on the previous evening. She thought he would
      remain for some time, as he was greatly pleased with the society of
      General Ivolgin and of the whole family. But he declared that he had only
      come to them in order to complete his education! The prince always enjoyed
      the company of Lebedeff&rsquo;s children, and today it was especially welcome,
      for Colia did not appear all day. Early that morning he had started for
      Petersburg. Lebedeff also was away on business. But Gavrila Ardalionovitch
      had promised to visit Muishkin, who eagerly awaited his coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      About seven in the evening, soon after dinner, he arrived. At the first
      glance it struck the prince that he, at any rate, must know all the
      details of last night&rsquo;s affair. Indeed, it would have been impossible for
      him to remain in ignorance considering the intimate relationship between
      him, Varvara Ardalionovna, and Ptitsin. But although he and the prince
      were intimate, in a sense, and although the latter had placed the
      Burdovsky affair in his hands&mdash;and this was not the only mark of
      confidence he had received&mdash;it seemed curious how many matters there
      were that were tacitly avoided in their conversations. Muishkin thought
      that Gania at times appeared to desire more cordiality and frankness. It
      was apparent now, when he entered, that he was convinced that the moment
      for breaking the ice between them had come at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      But all the same Gania was in haste, for his sister was waiting at
      Lebedeff&rsquo;s to consult him on an urgent matter of business. If he had
      anticipated impatient questions, or impulsive confidences, he was soon
      undeceived. The prince was thoughtful, reserved, even a little
      absent-minded, and asked none of the questions&mdash;one in particular&mdash;that
      Gania had expected. So he imitated the prince&rsquo;s demeanour, and talked fast
      and brilliantly upon all subjects but the one on which their thoughts were
      engaged. Among other things Gania told his host that Nastasia Philipovna
      had been only four days in Pavlofsk, and that everyone was talking about
      her already. She was staying with Daria Alexeyevna, in an ugly little
      house in Mattrossky Street, but drove about in the smartest carriage in
      the place. A crowd of followers had pursued her from the first, young and
      old. Some escorted her on horse-back when she took the air in her
      carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was as capricious as ever in the choice of her acquaintances, and
      admitted few into her narrow circle. Yet she already had a numerous
      following and many champions on whom she could depend in time of need. One
      gentleman on his holiday had broken off his engagement on her account, and
      an old general had quarrelled with his only son for the same reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was accompanied sometimes in her carriage by a girl of sixteen, a
      distant relative of her hostess. This young lady sang very well; in fact,
      her music had given a kind of notoriety to their little house. Nastasia,
      however, was behaving with great discretion on the whole. She dressed
      quietly, though with such taste as to drive all the ladies in Pavlofsk mad
      with envy, of that, as well as of her beauty and her carriage and horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for yesterday&rsquo;s episode,&rdquo; continued Gania, &ldquo;of course it was
      pre-arranged.&rdquo; Here he paused, as though expecting to be asked how he knew
      that. But the prince did not inquire. Concerning Evgenie Pavlovitch, Gania
      stated, without being asked, that he believed the former had not known
      Nastasia Philipovna in past years, but that he had probably been
      introduced to her by somebody in the park during these four days. As to
      the question of the IOU&rsquo;s she had spoken of, there might easily be
      something in that; for though Evgenie was undoubtedly a man of wealth, yet
      certain of his affairs were equally undoubtedly in disorder. Arrived at
      this interesting point, Gania suddenly broke off, and said no more about
      Nastasia&rsquo;s prank of the previous evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Varvara Ardalionovna came in search of her brother, and remained
      for a few minutes. Without Muishkin&rsquo;s asking her, she informed him that
      Evgenie Pavlovitch was spending the day in Petersburg, and perhaps would
      remain there over tomorrow; and that her husband had also gone to town,
      probably in connection with Evgenie Pavlovitch&rsquo;s affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lizabetha Prokofievna is in a really fiendish temper today,&rdquo; she added,
      as she went out, &ldquo;but the most curious thing is that Aglaya has quarrelled
      with her whole family; not only with her father and mother, but with her
      sisters also. It is not a good sign.&rdquo; She said all this quite casually,
      though it was extremely important in the eyes of the prince, and went off
      with her brother. Regarding the episode of &ldquo;Pavlicheff&rsquo;s son,&rdquo; Gania had
      been absolutely silent, partly from a kind of false modesty, partly,
      perhaps, to &ldquo;spare the prince&rsquo;s feelings.&rdquo; The latter, however, thanked
      him again for the trouble he had taken in the affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Muishkin was glad enough to be left alone. He went out of the garden,
      crossed the road, and entered the park. He wished to reflect, and to make
      up his mind as to a certain &ldquo;step.&rdquo; This step was one of those things,
      however, which are not thought out, as a rule, but decided for or against
      hastily, and without much reflection. The fact is, he felt a longing to
      leave all this and go away&mdash;go anywhere, if only it were far enough,
      and at once, without bidding farewell to anyone. He felt a presentiment
      that if he remained but a few days more in this place, and among these
      people, he would be fixed there irrevocably and permanently. However, in a
      very few minutes he decided that to run away was impossible; that it would
      be cowardly; that great problems lay before him, and that he had no right
      to leave them unsolved, or at least to refuse to give all his energy and
      strength to the attempt to solve them. Having come to this determination,
      he turned and went home, his walk having lasted less than a quarter of an
      hour. At that moment he was thoroughly unhappy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lebedeff had not returned, so towards evening Keller managed to penetrate
      into the prince&rsquo;s apartments. He was not drunk, but in a confidential and
      talkative mood. He announced that he had come to tell the story of his
      life to Muishkin, and had only remained at Pavlofsk for that purpose.
      There was no means of turning him out; nothing short of an earthquake
      would have removed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the manner of one with long hours before him, he began his history; but
      after a few incoherent words he jumped to the conclusion, which was that
      &ldquo;having ceased to believe in God Almighty, he had lost every vestige of
      morality, and had gone so far as to commit a theft.&rdquo; &ldquo;Could you imagine
      such a thing?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me, Keller,&rdquo; returned the prince. &ldquo;If I were in your place, I
      should not acknowledge that unless it were absolutely necessary for some
      reason. But perhaps you are making yourself out to be worse than you are,
      purposely?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should tell it to no one but yourself, prince, and I only name it now
      as a help to my soul&rsquo;s evolution. When I die, that secret will die with
      me! But, excellency, if you knew, if you only had the least idea, how
      difficult it is to get money nowadays! Where to find it is the question.
      Ask for a loan, the answer is always the same: &lsquo;Give us gold, jewels, or
      diamonds, and it will be quite easy.&rsquo; Exactly what one has not got! Can
      you picture that to yourself? I got angry at last, and said, &lsquo;I suppose
      you would accept emeralds?&rsquo; &lsquo;Certainly, we accept emeralds with pleasure.
      Yes!&rsquo; &lsquo;Well, that&rsquo;s all right,&rsquo; said I. &lsquo;Go to the devil, you den of
      thieves!&rsquo; And with that I seized my hat, and walked out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had you any emeralds?&rdquo; asked the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? I have emeralds? Oh, prince! with what simplicity, with what almost
      pastoral simplicity, you look upon life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Could not something be made of this man under good influences? asked the
      prince of himself, for he began to feel a kind of pity for his visitor. He
      thought little of the value of his own personal influence, not from a
      sense of humility, but from his peculiar way of looking at things in
      general. Imperceptibly the conversation grew more animated and more
      interesting, so that neither of the two felt anxious to bring it to a
      close. Keller confessed, with apparent sincerity, to having been guilty of
      many acts of such a nature that it astonished the prince that he could
      mention them, even to him. At every fresh avowal he professed the deepest
      repentance, and described himself as being &ldquo;bathed in tears&rdquo;; but this did
      not prevent him from putting on a boastful air at times, and some of his
      stories were so absurdly comical that both he and the prince laughed like
      madmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One point in your favour is that you seem to have a child-like mind, and
      extreme truthfulness,&rdquo; said the prince at last. &ldquo;Do you know that that
      atones for much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am assuredly noble-minded, and chivalrous to a degree!&rdquo; said Keller,
      much softened. &ldquo;But, do you know, this nobility of mind exists in a dream,
      if one may put it so? It never appears in practice or deed. Now, why is
      that? I can never understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not despair. I think we may say without fear of deceiving ourselves,
      that you have now given a fairly exact account of your life. I, at least,
      think it would be impossible to add much to what you have just told me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible?&rdquo; cried Keller, almost pityingly. &ldquo;Oh prince, how little you
      really seem to understand human nature!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there really much more to be added?&rdquo; asked the prince, with mild
      surprise. &ldquo;Well, what is it you really want of me? Speak out; tell me why
      you came to make your confession to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did I want? Well, to begin with, it is good to meet a man like you.
      It is a pleasure to talk over my faults with you. I know you for one of
      the best of men... and then... then...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated, and appeared so much embarrassed that the prince helped him
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you wanted me to lend you money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words were spoken in a grave tone, and even somewhat shyly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keller started, gave an astonished look at the speaker, and thumped the
      table with his fist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, prince, that&rsquo;s enough to knock me down! It astounds me! Here you
      are, as simple and innocent as a knight of the golden age, and yet...
      yet... you read a man&rsquo;s soul like a psychologist! Now, do explain it to
      me, prince, because I... I really do not understand!... Of course, my aim
      was to borrow money all along, and you... you asked the question as if
      there was nothing blameable in it&mdash;as if you thought it quite
      natural.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes... from you it is quite natural.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you are not offended?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I be offended?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, just listen, prince. I remained here last evening, partly because I
      have a great admiration for the French archbishop Bourdaloue. I enjoyed a
      discussion over him till three o&rsquo;clock in the morning, with Lebedeff; and
      then... then&mdash;I swear by all I hold sacred that I am telling you the
      truth&mdash;then I wished to develop my soul in this frank and heartfelt
      confession to you. This was my thought as I was sobbing myself to sleep at
      dawn. Just as I was losing consciousness, tears in my soul, tears on my
      face (I remember how I lay there sobbing), an idea from hell struck me.
      &lsquo;Why not, after confessing, borrow money from him?&rsquo; You see, this
      confession was a kind of masterstroke; I intended to use it as a means to
      your good grace and favour&mdash;and then&mdash;then I meant to walk off
      with a hundred and fifty roubles. Now, do you not call that base?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is hardly an exact statement of the case,&rdquo; said the prince in reply.
      &ldquo;You have confused your motives and ideas, as I need scarcely say too
      often happens to myself. I can assure you, Keller, I reproach myself
      bitterly for it sometimes. When you were talking just now I seemed to be
      listening to something about myself. At times I have imagined that all men
      were the same,&rdquo; he continued earnestly, for he appeared to be much
      interested in the conversation, &ldquo;and that consoled me in a certain degree,
      for a <i>double</i> motive is a thing most difficult to fight against. I
      have tried, and I know. God knows whence they arise, these ideas that you
      speak of as base. I fear these double motives more than ever just now, but
      I am not your judge, and in my opinion it is going too far to give the
      name of baseness to it&mdash;what do you think? You were going to employ
      your tears as a ruse in order to borrow money, but you also say&mdash;in
      fact, you have sworn to the fact&mdash;that independently of this your
      confession was made with an honourable motive. As for the money, you want
      it for drink, do you not? After your confession, that is weakness, of
      course; but, after all, how can anyone give up a bad habit at a moment&rsquo;s
      notice? It is impossible. What can we do? It is best, I think, to leave
      the matter to your own conscience. How does it seem to you?&rdquo; As he
      concluded the prince looked curiously at Keller; evidently this problem of
      double motives had often been considered by him before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, how anybody can call you an idiot after that, is more than I can
      understand!&rdquo; cried the boxer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince reddened slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bourdaloue, the archbishop, would not have spared a man like me,&rdquo; Keller
      continued, &ldquo;but you, you have judged me with humanity. To show how
      grateful I am, and as a punishment, I will not accept a hundred and fifty
      roubles. Give me twenty-five&mdash;that will be enough; it is all I really
      need, for a fortnight at least. I will not ask you for more for a
      fortnight. I should like to have given Agatha a present, but she does not
      really deserve it. Oh, my dear prince, God bless you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Lebedeff appeared, having just arrived from Petersburg. He
      frowned when he saw the twenty-five rouble note in Keller&rsquo;s hand, but the
      latter, having got the money, went away at once. Lebedeff began to abuse
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are unjust; I found him sincerely repentant,&rdquo; observed the prince,
      after listening for a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the good of repentance like that? It is the same exactly as mine
      yesterday, when I said, &lsquo;I am base, I am base,&rsquo;&mdash;words, and nothing
      more!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then they were only words on your part? I thought, on the contrary...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t mind telling you the truth&mdash;you only! Because you see
      through a man somehow. Words and actions, truth and falsehood, are all
      jumbled up together in me, and yet I am perfectly sincere. I feel the
      deepest repentance, believe it or not, as you choose; but words and lies
      come out in the infernal craving to get the better of other people. It is
      always there&mdash;the notion of cheating people, and of using my
      repentant tears to my own advantage! I assure you this is the truth,
      prince! I would not tell any other man for the world! He would laugh and
      jeer at me&mdash;but you, you judge a man humanely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Keller said the same thing to me nearly word for word a few minutes
      ago!&rdquo; cried Muishkin. &ldquo;And you both seem inclined to boast about it! You
      astonish me, but I think he is more sincere than you, for you make a
      regular trade of it. Oh, don&rsquo;t put on that pathetic expression, and don&rsquo;t
      put your hand on your heart! Have you anything to say to me? You have not
      come for nothing...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lebedeff grinned and wriggled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been waiting all day for you, because I want to ask you a
      question; and, for once in your life, please tell me the truth at once.
      Had you anything to do with that affair of the carriage yesterday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lebedeff began to grin again, rubbed his hands, sneezed, but spoke not a
      word in reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see you had something to do with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indirectly, quite indirectly! I am speaking the truth&mdash;I am indeed!
      I merely told a certain person that I had people in my house, and that
      such and such personages might be found among them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am aware that you sent your son to that house&mdash;he told me so
      himself just now, but what is this intrigue?&rdquo; said the prince,
      impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not my intrigue!&rdquo; cried Lebedeff, waving his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was engineered by other people, and is, properly speaking, rather a
      fantasy than an intrigue!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is it all about? Tell me, for Heaven&rsquo;s sake! Cannot you
      understand how nearly it touches me? Why are they blackening Evgenie
      Pavlovitch&rsquo;s reputation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lebedeff grimaced and wriggled again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prince!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Excellency! You won&rsquo;t let me tell you the whole truth;
      I have tried to explain; more than once I have begun, but you have not
      allowed me to go on...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince gave no answer, and sat deep in thought. Evidently he was
      struggling to decide.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well! Tell me the truth,&rdquo; he said, dejectedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aglaya Ivanovna...&rdquo; began Lebedeff, promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be silent! At once!&rdquo; interrupted the prince, red with indignation, and
      perhaps with shame, too. &ldquo;It is impossible and absurd! All that has been
      invented by you, or fools like you! Let me never hear you say a word again
      on that subject!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Late in the evening Colia came in with a whole budget of Petersburg and
      Pavlofsk news. He did not dwell much on the Petersburg part of it, which
      consisted chiefly of intelligence about his friend Hippolyte, but passed
      quickly to the Pavlofsk tidings. He had gone straight to the Epanchins&rsquo;
      from the station.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the deuce and all going on there!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;First of all about
      the row last night, and I think there must be something new as well,
      though I didn&rsquo;t like to ask. Not a word about <i>you</i>, prince, the
      whole time! The most interesting fact was that Aglaya had been quarrelling
      with her people about Gania. Colia did not know any details, except that
      it had been a terrible quarrel! Also Evgenie Pavlovitch had called, and
      met with an excellent reception all round. And another curious thing: Mrs.
      Epanchin was so angry that she called Varia to her&mdash;Varia was talking
      to the girls&mdash;and turned her out of the house &lsquo;once for all&rsquo; she
      said. I heard it from Varia herself&mdash;Mrs. Epanchin was quite polite,
      but firm; and when Varia said good-bye to the girls, she told them nothing
      about it, and they didn&rsquo;t know they were saying goodbye for the last time.
      I&rsquo;m sorry for Varia, and for Gania too; he isn&rsquo;t half a bad fellow, in
      spite of his faults, and I shall never forgive myself for not liking him
      before! I don&rsquo;t know whether I ought to continue to go to the Epanchins&rsquo;
      now,&rdquo; concluded Colia&mdash;&ldquo;I like to be quite independent of others, and
      of other people&rsquo;s quarrels if I can; but I must think over it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you need break your heart over Gania,&rdquo; said the prince;
      &ldquo;for if what you say is true, he must be considered dangerous in the
      Epanchin household, and if so, certain hopes of his must have been
      encouraged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? What hopes?&rdquo; cried Colia; &ldquo;you surely don&rsquo;t mean Aglaya?&mdash;oh,
      no!&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a dreadful sceptic, prince,&rdquo; he continued, after a moment&rsquo;s
      silence. &ldquo;I have observed of late that you have grown sceptical about
      everything. You don&rsquo;t seem to believe in people as you did, and are always
      attributing motives and so on&mdash;am I using the word &lsquo;sceptic&rsquo; in its
      proper sense?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe so; but I&rsquo;m not sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll change it, right or wrong; I&rsquo;ll say that you are not
      sceptical, but <i>jealous</i>. There! you are deadly jealous of Gania,
      over a certain proud damsel! Come!&rdquo; Colia jumped up, with these words, and
      burst out laughing. He laughed as he had perhaps never laughed before, and
      still more when he saw the prince flushing up to his temples. He was
      delighted that the prince should be jealous about Aglaya. However, he
      stopped immediately on seeing that the other was really hurt, and the
      conversation continued, very earnestly, for an hour or more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day the prince had to go to town, on business. Returning in the
      afternoon, he happened upon General Epanchin at the station. The latter
      seized his hand, glancing around nervously, as if he were afraid of being
      caught in wrong-doing, and dragged him into a first-class compartment. He
      was burning to speak about something of importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the first place, my dear prince, don&rsquo;t be angry with me. I would have
      come to see you yesterday, but I didn&rsquo;t know how Lizabetha Prokofievna
      would take it. My dear fellow, my house is simply a hell just now, a sort
      of sphinx has taken up its abode there. We live in an atmosphere of
      riddles; I can&rsquo;t make head or tail of anything. As for you, I feel sure
      you are the least to blame of any of us, though you certainly have been
      the cause of a good deal of trouble. You see, it&rsquo;s all very pleasant to be
      a philanthropist; but it can be carried too far. Of course I admire
      kind-heartedness, and I esteem my wife, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The general wandered on in this disconnected way for a long time; it was
      clear that he was much disturbed by some circumstance which he could make
      nothing of.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is plain to me, that <i>you</i> are not in it at all,&rdquo; he continued,
      at last, a little less vaguely, &ldquo;but perhaps you had better not come to
      our house for a little while. I ask you in the friendliest manner, mind;
      just till the wind changes again. As for Evgenie Pavlovitch,&rdquo; he continued
      with some excitement, &ldquo;the whole thing is a calumny, a dirty calumny. It
      is simply a plot, an intrigue, to upset our plans and to stir up a
      quarrel. You see, prince, I&rsquo;ll tell you privately, Evgenie and ourselves
      have not said a word yet, we have no formal understanding, we are in no
      way bound on either side, but the word may be said very soon, don&rsquo;t you
      see, <i>very</i> soon, and all this is most injurious, and is meant to be
      so. Why? I&rsquo;m sure I can&rsquo;t tell you. She&rsquo;s an extraordinary woman, you see,
      an eccentric woman; I tell you I am so frightened of that woman that I
      can&rsquo;t sleep. What a carriage that was, and where did it come from, eh? I
      declare, I was base enough to suspect Evgenie at first; but it seems
      certain that that cannot be the case, and if so, why is she interfering
      here? That&rsquo;s the riddle, what does she want? Is it to keep Evgenie to
      herself? But, my dear fellow, I swear to you, I swear he doesn&rsquo;t even <i>know</i>
      her, and as for those bills, why, the whole thing is an invention! And the
      familiarity of the woman! It&rsquo;s quite clear we must treat the impudent
      creature&rsquo;s attempt with disdain, and redouble our courtesy towards
      Evgenie. I told my wife so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll tell you my secret conviction. I&rsquo;m certain that she&rsquo;s doing this
      to revenge herself on me, on account of the past, though I assure you that
      all the time I was blameless. I blush at the very idea. And now she turns
      up again like this, when I thought she had finally disappeared! Where&rsquo;s
      Rogojin all this time? I thought she was Mrs. Rogojin, long ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man was in a state of great mental perturbation. The whole of the
      journey, which occupied nearly an hour, he continued in this strain,
      putting questions and answering them himself, shrugging his shoulders,
      pressing the prince&rsquo;s hand, and assuring the latter that, at all events,
      he had no suspicion whatever of <i>him</i>. This last assurance was
      satisfactory, at all events. The general finished by informing him that
      Evgenie&rsquo;s uncle was head of one of the civil service departments, and
      rich, very rich, and a gourmand. &ldquo;And, well, Heaven preserve him, of
      course&mdash;but Evgenie gets his money, don&rsquo;t you see? But, for all this,
      I&rsquo;m uncomfortable, I don&rsquo;t know why. There&rsquo;s something in the air, I feel
      there&rsquo;s something nasty in the air, like a bat, and I&rsquo;m by no means
      comfortable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And it was not until the third day that the formal reconciliation between
      the prince and the Epanchins took place, as said before.
    </p>
    <h3>
      XII.
    </h3>
    <p>
      It was seven in the evening, and the prince was just preparing to go out
      for a walk in the park, when suddenly Mrs. Epanchin appeared on the
      terrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the first place, don&rsquo;t dare to suppose,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;that I am going
      to apologize. Nonsense! You were entirely to blame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince remained silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you to blame, or not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, certainly not, no more than yourself, though at first I thought I
      was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, very well, let&rsquo;s sit down, at all events, for I don&rsquo;t intend to stand
      up all day. And remember, if you say, one word about &lsquo;mischievous
      urchins,&rsquo; I shall go away and break with you altogether. Now then, did
      you, or did you not, send a letter to Aglaya, a couple of months or so
      ago, about Easter-tide?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for? What was your object? Show me the letter.&rdquo; Mrs. Epanchin&rsquo;s eyes
      flashed; she was almost trembling with impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not got the letter,&rdquo; said the prince, timidly, extremely surprised
      at the turn the conversation had taken. &ldquo;If anyone has it, if it still
      exists, Aglaya Ivanovna must have it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No finessing, please. What did you write about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not finessing, and I am not in the least afraid of telling you; but
      I don&rsquo;t see the slightest reason why I should not have written.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be quiet, you can talk afterwards! What was the letter about? Why are you
      blushing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince was silent. At last he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand your thoughts, Lizabetha Prokofievna; but I can see
      that the fact of my having written is for some reason repugnant to you.
      You must admit that I have a perfect right to refuse to answer your
      questions; but, in order to show you that I am neither ashamed of the
      letter, nor sorry that I wrote it, and that I am not in the least inclined
      to blush about it&rdquo; (here the prince&rsquo;s blushes redoubled), &ldquo;I will repeat
      the substance of my letter, for I think I know it almost by heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, the prince repeated the letter almost word for word, as he had
      written it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My goodness, what utter twaddle, and what may all this nonsense have
      signified, pray? If it had any meaning at all!&rdquo; said Mrs. Epanchin,
      cuttingly, after having listened with great attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t absolutely know myself; I know my feeling was very
      sincere. I had moments at that time full of life and hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of hope?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is difficult to explain, but certainly not the hopes you have in your
      mind. Hopes&mdash;well, in a word, hopes for the future, and a feeling of
      joy that <i>there</i>, at all events, I was not entirely a stranger and a
      foreigner. I felt an ecstasy in being in my native land once more; and one
      sunny morning I took up a pen and wrote her that letter, but why to <i>her</i>,
      I don&rsquo;t quite know. Sometimes one longs to have a friend near, and I
      evidently felt the need of one then,&rdquo; added the prince, and paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you in love with her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N-no! I wrote to her as to a sister; I signed myself her brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, of course, on purpose! I quite understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very painful to me to answer these questions, Lizabetha
      Prokofievna.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say it is; but that&rsquo;s no affair of mine. Now then, assure me truly
      as before Heaven, are you lying to me or not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I am not lying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you telling the truth when you say you are not in love?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe it is the absolute truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I believe,&rsquo; indeed! Did that mischievous urchin give it to her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I asked Nicolai Ardalionovitch...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The urchin! the urchin!&rdquo; interrupted Lizabetha Prokofievna in an angry
      voice. &ldquo;I do not want to know if it were Nicolai Ardalionovitch! The
      urchin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nicolai Ardalionovitch...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The urchin, I tell you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it was not the urchin: it was Nicolai Ardalionovitch,&rdquo; said the
      prince very firmly, but without raising his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, all right! All right, my dear! I shall put that down to your
      account.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was silent a moment to get breath, and to recover her composure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&mdash;and what&rsquo;s the meaning of the &lsquo;poor knight,&rsquo; eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know in the least; I wasn&rsquo;t present when the joke was made. It <i>is</i>
      a joke. I suppose, and that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s a comfort, at all events. You don&rsquo;t suppose she could take
      any interest in you, do you? Why, she called you an &lsquo;idiot&rsquo; herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you might have spared me that,&rdquo; murmured the prince
      reproachfully, almost in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be angry; she is a wilful, mad, spoilt girl. If she likes a person
      she will pitch into him, and chaff him. I used to be just such another.
      But for all that you needn&rsquo;t flatter yourself, my boy; she is not for you.
      I don&rsquo;t believe it, and it is not to be. I tell you so at once, so that
      you may take proper precautions. Now, I want to hear you swear that you
      are not married to that woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lizabetha Prokofievna, what are you thinking of?&rdquo; cried the prince,
      almost leaping to his feet in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? You very nearly were, anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I nearly was,&rdquo; whispered the prince, hanging his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then, have you come here for <i>her?</i> Are you in love with <i>her?</i>
      With <i>that</i> creature?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not come to marry at all,&rdquo; replied the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there anything you hold sacred?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then swear by it that you did not come here to marry <i>her!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll swear it by whatever you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you. You may kiss me; I breathe freely at last. But you must
      know, my dear friend, Aglaya does not love you, and she shall never be
      your wife while I am out of my grave. So be warned in time. Do you hear
      me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I hear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince flushed up so much that he could not look her in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have waited for you with the greatest impatience (not that you were
      worth it). Every night I have drenched my pillow with tears, not for you,
      my friend, not for you, don&rsquo;t flatter yourself! I have my own grief,
      always the same, always the same. But I&rsquo;ll tell you why I have been
      awaiting you so impatiently, because I believe that Providence itself sent
      you to be a friend and a brother to me. I haven&rsquo;t a friend in the world
      except Princess Bielokonski, and she is growing as stupid as a sheep from
      old age. Now then, tell me, yes or no? Do you know why she called out from
      her carriage the other night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I give you my word of honour that I had nothing to do with the matter and
      know nothing about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, I believe you. I have my own ideas about it. Up to yesterday
      morning I thought it was really Evgenie Pavlovitch who was to blame; now I
      cannot help agreeing with the others. But why he was made such a fool of I
      cannot understand. However, he is not going to marry Aglaya, I can tell
      you that. He may be a very excellent fellow, but&mdash;so it shall be. I
      was not at all sure of accepting him before, but now I have quite made up
      my mind that I won&rsquo;t have him. &lsquo;Put me in my coffin first and then into my
      grave, and then you may marry my daughter to whomsoever you please,&rsquo; so I
      said to the general this very morning. You see how I trust you, my boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I see and understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Epanchin gazed keenly into the prince&rsquo;s eyes. She was anxious to see
      what impression the news as to Evgenie Pavlovitch had made upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know anything about Gavrila Ardalionovitch?&rdquo; she asked at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, I know a good deal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you know he had communications with Aglaya?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the prince, trembling a little, and in great
      agitation. &ldquo;You say Gavrila Ardalionovitch has private communications with
      Aglaya?&mdash;Impossible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only quite lately. His sister has been working like a rat to clear the
      way for him all the winter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it!&rdquo; said the prince abruptly, after a short pause. &ldquo;Had
      it been so I should have known long ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, of course, yes; he would have come and wept out his secret on your
      bosom. Oh, you simpleton&mdash;you simpleton! Anyone can deceive you and
      take you in like a&mdash;like a,&mdash;aren&rsquo;t you ashamed to trust him?
      Can&rsquo;t you see that he humbugs you just as much as ever he pleases?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know very well that he does deceive me occasionally, and he knows that
      I know it, but&mdash;&rdquo; The prince did not finish his sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s why you trust him, eh? So I should have supposed. Good Lord,
      was there ever such a man as you? Tfu! and are you aware, sir, that this
      Gania, or his sister Varia, have brought her into correspondence with
      Nastasia Philipovna?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brought whom?&rdquo; cried Muishkin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aglaya.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it! It&rsquo;s impossible! What object could they have?&rdquo; He
      jumped up from his chair in his excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor do I believe it, in spite of the proofs. The girl is self-willed and
      fantastic, and insane! She&rsquo;s wicked, wicked! I&rsquo;ll repeat it for a thousand
      years that she&rsquo;s wicked; they <i>all</i> are, just now, all my daughters,
      even that &lsquo;wet hen&rsquo; Alexandra. And yet I don&rsquo;t believe it. Because I don&rsquo;t
      choose to believe it, perhaps; but I don&rsquo;t. Why haven&rsquo;t you been?&rdquo; she
      turned on the prince suddenly. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you come near us all these
      three days, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince began to give his reasons, but she interrupted him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everybody takes you in and deceives you; you went to town yesterday. I
      dare swear you went down on your knees to that rogue, and begged him to
      accept your ten thousand roubles!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never thought of doing any such thing. I have not seen him, and he is
      not a rogue, in my opinion. I have had a letter from him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show it me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince took a paper from his pocket-book, and handed it to Lizabetha
      Prokofievna. It ran as follows:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p class="salutation sc">
        &ldquo;Sir,
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;In the eyes of the world I am sure that I have no cause for pride or
        self-esteem. I am much too insignificant for that. But what may be so to
        other men&rsquo;s eyes is not so to yours. I am convinced that you are better
        than other people. Doktorenko disagrees with me, but I am content to
        differ from him on this point. I will never accept one single copeck
        from you, but you have helped my mother, and I am bound to be grateful
        to you for that, however weak it may seem. At any rate, I have changed
        my opinion about you, and I think right to inform you of the fact; but I
        also suppose that there can be no further intercourse between us.
      </p>
      <p class="sig sc">
        &ldquo;Antip Burdovsky.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;P.S.&mdash;The two hundred roubles I owe you shall certainly be repaid
        in time.&rdquo;
       </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How extremely stupid!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Epanchin, giving back the letter
      abruptly. &ldquo;It was not worth the trouble of reading. Why are you smiling?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confess that you are pleased to have read it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Pleased with all that nonsense! Why, cannot you see that they are
      all infatuated with pride and vanity?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has acknowledged himself to be in the wrong. Don&rsquo;t you see that the
      greater his vanity, the more difficult this admission must have been on
      his part? Oh, what a little child you are, Lizabetha Prokofievna!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you tempting me to box your ears for you, or what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. I am only proving that you are glad about the letter. Why
      conceal your real feelings? You always like to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never come near my house again!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Epanchin, pale with rage.
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let me see as much as a <i>shadow</i> of you about the place! Do
      you hear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, and in three days you&rsquo;ll come and invite me yourself. Aren&rsquo;t you
      ashamed now? These are your best feelings; you are only tormenting
      yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll die before I invite you! I shall forget your very name! I&rsquo;ve
      forgotten it already!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She marched towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m forbidden your house as it is, without your added threats!&rdquo; cried
      the prince after her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Who forbade you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned round so suddenly that one might have supposed a needle had
      been stuck into her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince hesitated. He perceived that he had said too much now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Who</i> forbade you?&rdquo; cried Mrs. Epanchin once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aglaya Ivanovna told me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When? Speak&mdash;quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She sent to say, yesterday morning, that I was never to dare to come near
      the house again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lizabetha Prokofievna stood like a stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did she send? Whom? Was it that boy? Was it a message?&mdash;quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had a note,&rdquo; said the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is it? Give it here, at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince thought a moment. Then he pulled out of his waistcoat pocket an
      untidy slip of paper, on which was scrawled:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &ldquo;<span class="sc">Prince Lef Nicolaievitch</span>,&mdash;If you think
        fit, after all that has passed, to honour our house with a visit, I can
        assure you you will not find me among the number of those who are in any
        way delighted to see you.
      </p>
      <p class="sig sc">
        &ldquo;Aglaya Epanchin.&rdquo;
       </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Mrs. Epanchin reflected a moment. The next minute she flew at the prince,
      seized his hand, and dragged him after her to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quick&mdash;come along!&rdquo; she cried, breathless with agitation and
      impatience. &ldquo;Come along with me this moment!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you declared I wasn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a simpleton. You behave just as though you weren&rsquo;t a man at all.
      Come on! I shall see, now, with my own eyes. I shall see all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let me get my hat, at least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your miserable hat. He couldn&rsquo;t even choose a respectable shape
      for his hat! Come on! She did that because I took your part and said you
      ought to have come&mdash;little vixen!&mdash;else she would never have
      sent you that silly note. It&rsquo;s a most improper note, I call it; most
      improper for such an intelligent, well-brought-up girl to write. H&rsquo;m! I
      dare say she was annoyed that you didn&rsquo;t come; but she ought to have known
      that one can&rsquo;t write like that to an idiot like you, for you&rsquo;d be sure to
      take it literally.&rdquo; Mrs. Epanchin was dragging the prince along with her
      all the time, and never let go of his hand for an instant. &ldquo;What are you
      listening for?&rdquo; she added, seeing that she had committed herself a little.
      &ldquo;She wants a clown like you&mdash;she hasn&rsquo;t seen one for some time&mdash;to
      play with. That&rsquo;s why she is anxious for you to come to the house. And
      right glad I am that she&rsquo;ll make a thorough good fool of you. You deserve
      it; and she can do it&mdash;oh! she can, indeed!&mdash;as well as most
      people.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      PART III
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Epanchin family, or at least the more serious members of it, were
      sometimes grieved because they seemed so unlike the rest of the world.
      They were not quite certain, but had at times a strong suspicion that
      things did not happen to them as they did to other people. Others led a
      quiet, uneventful life, while they were subject to continual upheavals.
      Others kept on the rails without difficulty; they ran off at the slightest
      obstacle. Other houses were governed by a timid routine; theirs was
      somehow different. Perhaps Lizabetha Prokofievna was alone in making these
      fretful observations; the girls, though not wanting in intelligence, were
      still young; the general was intelligent, too, but narrow, and in any
      difficulty he was content to say, &ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; and leave the matter to his wife.
      Consequently, on her fell the responsibility. It was not that they
      distinguished themselves as a family by any particular originality, or
      that their excursions off the track led to any breach of the proprieties.
      Oh no.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing premeditated, there was not even any conscious purpose
      in it all, and yet, in spite of everything, the family, although highly
      respected, was not quite what every highly respected family ought to be.
      For a long time now Lizabetha Prokofievna had had it in her mind that all
      the trouble was owing to her &ldquo;unfortunate character,&rdquo; and this added to
      her distress. She blamed her own stupid unconventional &ldquo;eccentricity.&rdquo;
       Always restless, always on the go, she constantly seemed to lose her way,
      and to get into trouble over the simplest and more ordinary affairs of
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      We said at the beginning of our story, that the Epanchins were liked and
      esteemed by their neighbours. In spite of his humble origin, Ivan
      Fedorovitch himself was received everywhere with respect. He deserved
      this, partly on account of his wealth and position, partly because, though
      limited, he was really a very good fellow. But a certain limitation of
      mind seems to be an indispensable asset, if not to all public personages,
      at least to all serious financiers. Added to this, his manner was modest
      and unassuming; he knew when to be silent, yet never allowed himself to be
      trampled upon. Also&mdash;and this was more important than all&mdash;he
      had the advantage of being under exalted patronage.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to Lizabetha Prokofievna, she, as the reader knows, belonged to an
      aristocratic family. True, Russians think more of influential friends than
      of birth, but she had both. She was esteemed and even loved by people of
      consequence in society, whose example in receiving her was therefore
      followed by others. It seems hardly necessary to remark that her family
      worries and anxieties had little or no foundation, or that her imagination
      increased them to an absurd degree; but if you have a wart on your
      forehead or nose, you imagine that all the world is looking at it, and
      that people would make fun of you because of it, even if you had
      discovered America! Doubtless Lizabetha Prokofievna was considered
      &ldquo;eccentric&rdquo; in society, but she was none the less esteemed: the pity was
      that she was ceasing to believe in that esteem. When she thought of her
      daughters, she said to herself sorrowfully that she was a hindrance rather
      than a help to their future, that her character and temper were absurd,
      ridiculous, insupportable. Naturally, she put the blame on her
      surroundings, and from morning to night was quarrelling with her husband
      and children, whom she really loved to the point of self-sacrifice, even,
      one might say, of passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was, above all distressed by the idea that her daughters might grow up
      &ldquo;eccentric,&rdquo; like herself; she believed that no other society girls were
      like them. &ldquo;They are growing into Nihilists!&rdquo; she repeated over and over
      again. For years she had tormented herself with this idea, and with the
      question: &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t they get married?&rdquo;
     </p>

      &ldquo;It is to annoy their mother; that is their one aim in life; it can be
      nothing else. The fact is it is all of a piece with these modern ideas,
      that wretched woman&rsquo;s question! Six months ago Aglaya took a fancy to cut
      off her magnificent hair. Why, even I, when I was young, had nothing like
      it! The scissors were in her hand, and I had to go down on my knees and
      implore her... She did it, I know, from sheer mischief, to spite her
      mother, for she is a naughty, capricious girl, a real spoiled child
      spiteful and mischievous to a degree! And then Alexandra wanted to shave
      her head, not from caprice or mischief, but, like a little fool, simply
      because Aglaya persuaded her she would sleep better without her hair, and
      not suffer from headache! And how many suitors have they not had during
      the last five years! Excellent offers, too! What more do they want? Why
      don&rsquo;t they get married? For no other reason than to vex their mother&mdash;none&mdash;none!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Lizabetha Prokofievna felt somewhat consoled when she could say that
      one of her girls, Adelaida, was settled at last. &ldquo;It will be one off our
      hands!&rdquo; she declared aloud, though in private she expressed herself with
      greater tenderness. The engagement was both happy and suitable, and was
      therefore approved in society. Prince S. was a distinguished man, he had
      money, and his future wife was devoted to him; what more could be desired?
      Lizabetha Prokofievna had felt less anxious about this daughter, however,
      although she considered her artistic tastes suspicious. But to make up for
      them she was, as her mother expressed it, &ldquo;merry,&rdquo; and had plenty of
      &ldquo;common-sense.&rdquo; It was Aglaya&rsquo;s future which disturbed her most. With
      regard to her eldest daughter, Alexandra, the mother never quite knew
      whether there was cause for anxiety or not. Sometimes she felt as if there
      was nothing to be expected from her. She was twenty-five now, and must be
      fated to be an old maid, and &ldquo;with such beauty, too!&rdquo; The mother spent
      whole nights in weeping and lamenting, while all the time the cause of her
      grief slumbered peacefully. &ldquo;What is the matter with her? Is she a
      Nihilist, or simply a fool?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Lizabetha Prokofievna knew perfectly well how unnecessary was the last
      question. She set a high value on Alexandra Ivanovna&rsquo;s judgment, and often
      consulted her in difficulties; but that she was a &lsquo;wet hen&rsquo; she never for
      a moment doubted. &ldquo;She is so calm; nothing rouses her&mdash;though wet
      hens are not always calm! Oh! I can&rsquo;t understand it!&rdquo; Her eldest daughter
      inspired Lizabetha with a kind of puzzled compassion. She did not feel
      this in Aglaya&rsquo;s case, though the latter was her idol. It may be said that
      these outbursts and epithets, such as &ldquo;wet hen&rdquo; (in which the maternal
      solicitude usually showed itself), only made Alexandra laugh. Sometimes
      the most trivial thing annoyed Mrs. Epanchin, and drove her into a frenzy.
      For instance, Alexandra Ivanovna liked to sleep late, and was always
      dreaming, though her dreams had the peculiarity of being as innocent and
      naive as those of a child of seven; and the very innocence of her dreams
      annoyed her mother. Once she dreamt of nine hens, and this was the cause
      of quite a serious quarrel&mdash;no one knew why. Another time she had&mdash;it
      was most unusual&mdash;a dream with a spark of originality in it. She
      dreamt of a monk in a dark room, into which she was too frightened to go.
      Adelaida and Aglaya rushed off with shrieks of laughter to relate this to
      their mother, but she was quite angry, and said her daughters were all
      fools.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m! she is as stupid as a fool! A veritable &lsquo;wet hen&rsquo;! Nothing excites
      her; and yet she is not happy; some days it makes one miserable only to
      look at her! Why is she unhappy, I wonder?&rdquo; At times Lizabetha Prokofievna
      put this question to her husband, and as usual she spoke in the
      threatening tone of one who demands an immediate answer. Ivan Fedorovitch
      would frown, shrug his shoulders, and at last give his opinion: &ldquo;She needs
      a husband!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God forbid that he should share your ideas, Ivan Fedorovitch!&rdquo; his wife
      flashed back. &ldquo;Or that he should be as gross and churlish as you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The general promptly made his escape, and Lizabetha Prokofievna after a
      while grew calm again. That evening, of course, she would be unusually
      attentive, gentle, and respectful to her &ldquo;gross and churlish&rdquo; husband, her
      &ldquo;dear, kind Ivan Fedorovitch,&rdquo; for she had never left off loving him. She
      was even still &ldquo;in love&rdquo; with him. He knew it well, and for his part held
      her in the greatest esteem.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the mother&rsquo;s great and continual anxiety was Aglaya. &ldquo;She is exactly
      like me&mdash;my image in everything,&rdquo; said Mrs. Epanchin to herself. &ldquo;A
      tyrant! A real little demon! A Nihilist! Eccentric, senseless and
      mischievous! Good Lord, how unhappy she will be!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But as we said before, the fact of Adelaida&rsquo;s approaching marriage was
      balm to the mother. For a whole month she forgot her fears and worries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adelaida&rsquo;s fate was settled; and with her name that of Aglaya&rsquo;s was
      linked, in society gossip. People whispered that Aglaya, too, was &ldquo;as good
      as engaged;&rdquo; and Aglaya always looked so sweet and behaved so well (during
      this period), that the mother&rsquo;s heart was full of joy. Of course, Evgenie
      Pavlovitch must be thoroughly studied first, before the final step should
      be taken; but, really, how lovely dear Aglaya had become&mdash;she
      actually grew more beautiful every day! And then&mdash;Yes, and then&mdash;this
      abominable prince showed his face again, and everything went topsy-turvy
      at once, and everyone seemed as mad as March hares.
    </p>
    <p>
      What had really happened?
    </p>
    <p>
      If it had been any other family than the Epanchins&rsquo;, nothing particular
      would have happened. But, thanks to Mrs. Epanchin&rsquo;s invariable fussiness
      and anxiety, there could not be the slightest hitch in the simplest
      matters of everyday life, but she immediately foresaw the most dreadful
      and alarming consequences, and suffered accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      What then must have been her condition, when, among all the imaginary
      anxieties and calamities which so constantly beset her, she now saw
      looming ahead a serious cause for annoyance&mdash;something really likely
      to arouse doubts and suspicions!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How dared they, how <i>dared</i> they write that hateful anonymous letter
      informing me that Aglaya is in communication with Nastasia Philipovna?&rdquo;
       she thought, as she dragged the prince along towards her own house, and
      again when she sat him down at the round table where the family was
      already assembled. &ldquo;How dared they so much as <i>think</i> of such a
      thing? I should <i>die</i> with shame if I thought there was a particle of
      truth in it, or if I were to show the letter to Aglaya herself! Who dares
      play these jokes upon <i>us</i>, the Epanchins? <i>Why</i> didn&rsquo;t we go to
      the Yelagin instead of coming down here? I <i>told</i> you we had better
      go to the Yelagin this summer, Ivan Fedorovitch. It&rsquo;s all your fault. I
      dare say it was that Varia who sent the letter. It&rsquo;s all Ivan Fedorovitch.
      <i>That</i> woman is doing it all for him, I know she is, to show she can
      make a fool of him now just as she did when he used to give her pearls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But after all is said, we are mixed up in it. Your daughters are mixed up
      in it, Ivan Fedorovitch; young ladies in society, young ladies at an age
      to be married; they were present, they heard everything there was to hear.
      They were mixed up with that other scene, too, with those dreadful youths.
      You must be pleased to remember they heard it all. I cannot forgive that
      wretched prince. I never shall forgive him! And why, if you please, has
      Aglaya had an attack of nerves for these last three days? Why has she all
      but quarrelled with her sisters, even with Alexandra&mdash;whom she
      respects so much that she always kisses her hands as though she were her
      mother? What are all these riddles of hers that we have to guess? What has
      Gavrila Ardalionovitch to do with it? Why did she take upon herself to
      champion him this morning, and burst into tears over it? Why is there an
      allusion to that cursed &lsquo;poor knight&rsquo; in the anonymous letter? And why did
      I rush off to him just now like a lunatic, and drag him back here? I do
      believe I&rsquo;ve gone mad at last. What on earth have I done now? To talk to a
      young man about my daughter&rsquo;s secrets&mdash;and secrets having to do with
      himself, too! Thank goodness, he&rsquo;s an idiot, and a friend of the house!
      Surely Aglaya hasn&rsquo;t fallen in love with such a gaby! What an idea! Pfu!
      we ought all to be put under glass cases&mdash;myself first of all&mdash;and
      be shown off as curiosities, at ten copecks a peep!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall never forgive you for all this, Ivan Fedorovitch&mdash;never!
      Look at her now. Why doesn&rsquo;t she make fun of him? She said she would, and
      she doesn&rsquo;t. Look there! She stares at him with all her eyes, and doesn&rsquo;t
      move; and yet she told him not to come. He looks pale enough; and that
      abominable chatterbox, Evgenie Pavlovitch, monopolizes the whole of the
      conversation. Nobody else can get a word in. I could soon find out all
      about everything if I could only change the subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince certainly was very pale. He sat at the table and seemed to be
      feeling, by turns, sensations of alarm and rapture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, how frightened he was of looking to one side&mdash;one particular
      corner&mdash;whence he knew very well that a pair of dark eyes were
      watching him intently, and how happy he was to think that he was once more
      among them, and occasionally hearing that well-known voice, although she
      had written and forbidden him to come again!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth will she say to me, I wonder?&rdquo; he thought to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not said a word yet; he sat silent and listened to Evgenie
      Pavlovitch&rsquo;s eloquence. The latter had never appeared so happy and excited
      as on this evening. The prince listened to him, but for a long time did
      not take in a word he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Excepting Ivan Fedorovitch, who had not as yet returned from town, the
      whole family was present. Prince S. was there; and they all intended to go
      out to hear the band very soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colia arrived presently and joined the circle. &ldquo;So he is received as
      usual, after all,&rdquo; thought the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Epanchins&rsquo; country-house was a charming building, built after the
      model of a Swiss chalet, and covered with creepers. It was surrounded on
      all sides by a flower garden, and the family sat, as a rule, on the open
      verandah as at the prince&rsquo;s house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The subject under discussion did not appear to be very popular with the
      assembly, and some would have been delighted to change it; but Evgenie
      would not stop holding forth, and the prince&rsquo;s arrival seemed to spur him
      on to still further oratorical efforts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lizabetha Prokofievna frowned, but had not as yet grasped the subject,
      which seemed to have arisen out of a heated argument. Aglaya sat apart,
      almost in the corner, listening in stubborn silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; continued Evgenie Pavlovitch hotly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say a word
      against liberalism. Liberalism is not a sin, it is a necessary part of a
      great whole, which whole would collapse and fall to pieces without it.
      Liberalism has just as much right to exist as has the most moral
      conservatism; but I am attacking <i>Russian</i> liberalism; and I attack
      it for the simple reason that a Russian liberal is not a Russian liberal,
      he is a non-Russian liberal. Show me a real Russian liberal, and I&rsquo;ll kiss
      him before you all, with pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he cared to kiss you, that is,&rdquo; said Alexandra, whose cheeks were red
      with irritation and excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at that, now,&rdquo; thought the mother to herself, &ldquo;she does nothing but
      sleep and eat for a year at a time, and then suddenly flies out in the
      most incomprehensible way!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince observed that Alexandra appeared to be angry with Evgenie,
      because he spoke on a serious subject in a frivolous manner, pretending to
      be in earnest, but with an under-current of irony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was saying just now, before you came in, prince, that there has been
      nothing national up to now, about our liberalism, and nothing the liberals
      do, or have done, is in the least degree national. They are drawn from two
      classes only, the old landowning class, and clerical families&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How, nothing that they have done is Russian?&rdquo; asked Prince S.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be Russian, but it is not national. Our liberals are not Russian,
      nor are our conservatives, and you may be sure that the nation does not
      recognize anything that has been done by the landed gentry, or by the
      seminarists, or what is to be done either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, that&rsquo;s good! How can you maintain such a paradox? If you are
      serious, that is. I cannot allow such a statement about the landed
      proprietors to pass unchallenged. Why, you are a landed proprietor
      yourself!&rdquo; cried Prince S. hotly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ll say there is nothing national about our literature
      either?&rdquo; said Alexandra.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I am not a great authority on literary questions, but I certainly
      do hold that Russian literature is not Russian, except perhaps Lomonosoff,
      Pouschkin and Gogol.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the first place, that is a considerable admission, and in the second
      place, one of the above was a peasant, and the other two were both landed
      proprietors!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so, but don&rsquo;t be in such a hurry! For since it has been the part of
      these three men, and only these three, to say something absolutely their
      own, not borrowed, so by this very fact these three men become really
      national. If any Russian shall have done or said anything really and
      absolutely original, he is to be called national from that moment, though
      he may not be able to talk the Russian language; still he is a national
      Russian. I consider that an axiom. But we were not speaking of literature;
      we began by discussing the socialists. Very well then, I insist that there
      does not exist one single Russian socialist. There does not, and there has
      never existed such a one, because all socialists are derived from the two
      classes&mdash;the landed proprietors, and the seminarists. All our eminent
      socialists are merely old liberals of the class of landed proprietors, men
      who were liberals in the days of serfdom. Why do you laugh? Give me their
      books, give me their studies, their memoirs, and though I am not a
      literary critic, yet I will prove as clear as day that every chapter and
      every word of their writings has been the work of a former landed
      proprietor of the old school. You&rsquo;ll find that all their raptures, all
      their generous transports are proprietary, all their woes and their tears,
      proprietary; all proprietary or seminarist! You are laughing again, and
      you, prince, are smiling too. Don&rsquo;t you agree with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was true enough that everybody was laughing, the prince among them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot tell you on the instant whether I agree with you or not,&rdquo; said
      the latter, suddenly stopping his laughter, and starting like a schoolboy
      caught at mischief. &ldquo;But, I assure you, I am listening to you with extreme
      gratification.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he almost panted with agitation, and a cold sweat stood upon
      his forehead. These were his first words since he had entered the house;
      he tried to lift his eyes, and look around, but dared not; Evgenie
      Pavlovitch noticed his confusion, and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just tell you one fact, ladies and gentlemen,&rdquo; continued the latter,
      with apparent seriousness and even exaltation of manner, but with a
      suggestion of &ldquo;chaff&rdquo; behind every word, as though he were laughing in his
      sleeve at his own nonsense&mdash;&ldquo;a fact, the discovery of which, I
      believe, I may claim to have made by myself alone. At all events, no other
      has ever said or written a word about it; and in this fact is expressed
      the whole essence of Russian liberalism of the sort which I am now
      considering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the first place, what is liberalism, speaking generally, but an attack
      (whether mistaken or reasonable, is quite another question) upon the
      existing order of things? Is this so? Yes. Very well. Then my &lsquo;fact&rsquo;
      consists in this, that <i>Russian</i> liberalism is not an attack upon the
      existing order of things, but an attack upon the very essence of things
      themselves&mdash;indeed, on the things themselves; not an attack on the
      Russian order of things, but on Russia itself. My Russian liberal goes so
      far as to reject Russia; that is, he hates and strikes his own mother.
      Every misfortune and mishap of the mother-country fills him with mirth,
      and even with ecstasy. He hates the national customs, Russian history, and
      everything. If he has a justification, it is that he does not know what he
      is doing, and believes that his hatred of Russia is the grandest and most
      profitable kind of liberalism. (You will often find a liberal who is
      applauded and esteemed by his fellows, but who is in reality the
      dreariest, blindest, dullest of conservatives, and is not aware of the
      fact.) This hatred for Russia has been mistaken by some of our &lsquo;Russian
      liberals&rsquo; for sincere love of their country, and they boast that they see
      better than their neighbours what real love of one&rsquo;s country should
      consist in. But of late they have grown, more candid and are ashamed of
      the expression &lsquo;love of country,&rsquo; and have annihilated the very spirit of
      the words as something injurious and petty and undignified. This is the
      truth, and I hold by it; but at the same time it is a phenomenon which has
      not been repeated at any other time or place; and therefore, though I hold
      to it as a fact, yet I recognize that it is an accidental phenomenon, and
      may likely enough pass away. There can be no such thing anywhere else as a
      liberal who really hates his country; and how is this fact to be explained
      among <i>us?</i> By my original statement that a Russian liberal is <i>not</i>
      a <i>Russian</i> liberal&mdash;that&rsquo;s the only explanation that I can
      see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I take all that you have said as a joke,&rdquo; said Prince S. seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not seen all kinds of liberals, and cannot, therefore, set myself
      up as a judge,&rdquo; said Alexandra, &ldquo;but I have heard all you have said with
      indignation. You have taken some accidental case and twisted it into a
      universal law, which is unjust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Accidental case!&rdquo; said Evgenie Pavlovitch. &ldquo;Do you consider it an
      accidental case, prince?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must also admit,&rdquo; said the prince, &ldquo;that I have not seen much, or been
      very far into the question; but I cannot help thinking that you are more
      or less right, and that Russian liberalism&mdash;that phase of it which
      you are considering, at least&mdash;really is sometimes inclined to hate
      Russia itself, and not only its existing order of things in general. Of
      course this is only <i>partially</i> the truth; you cannot lay down the
      law for all...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince blushed and broke off, without finishing what he meant to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of his shyness and agitation, he could not help being greatly
      interested in the conversation. A special characteristic of his was the
      naive candour with which he always listened to arguments which interested
      him, and with which he answered any questions put to him on the subject at
      issue. In the very expression of his face this naivete was unmistakably
      evident, this disbelief in the insincerity of others, and unsuspecting
      disregard of irony or humour in their words.
    </p>
    <p>
      But though Evgenie Pavlovitch had put his questions to the prince with no
      other purpose but to enjoy the joke of his simple-minded seriousness, yet
      now, at his answer, he was surprised into some seriousness himself, and
      looked gravely at Muishkin as though he had not expected that sort of
      answer at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, how strange!&rdquo; he ejaculated. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t answer me seriously,
      surely, did you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did not you ask me the question seriously&rdquo; inquired the prince, in
      amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everybody laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, trust <i>him</i> for that!&rdquo; said Adelaida. &ldquo;Evgenie Pavlovitch turns
      everything and everybody he can lay hold of to ridicule. You should hear
      the things he says sometimes, apparently in perfect seriousness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my opinion the conversation has been a painful one throughout, and we
      ought never to have begun it,&rdquo; said Alexandra. &ldquo;We were all going for a
      walk&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along then,&rdquo; said Evgenie; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a glorious evening. But, to prove
      that this time I was speaking absolutely seriously, and especially to
      prove this to the prince (for you, prince, have interested me exceedingly,
      and I swear to you that I am not quite such an ass as I like to appear
      sometimes, although I am rather an ass, I admit), and&mdash;well, ladies
      and gentlemen, will you allow me to put just one more question to the
      prince, out of pure curiosity? It shall be the last. This question came
      into my mind a couple of hours since (you see, prince, I do think
      seriously at times), and I made my own decision upon it; now I wish to
      hear what the prince will say to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have just used the expression &lsquo;accidental case.&rsquo; This is a significant
      phrase; we often hear it. Well, not long since everyone was talking and
      reading about that terrible murder of six people on the part of a&mdash;young
      fellow, and of the extraordinary speech of the counsel for the defence,
      who observed that in the poverty-stricken condition of the criminal it
      must have come <i>naturally</i> into his head to kill these six people. I
      do not quote his words, but that is the sense of them, or something very
      like it. Now, in my opinion, the barrister who put forward this
      extraordinary plea was probably absolutely convinced that he was stating
      the most liberal, the most humane, the most enlightened view of the case
      that could possibly be brought forward in these days. Now, was this
      distortion, this capacity for a perverted way of viewing things, a special
      or accidental case, or is such a general rule?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Everyone laughed at this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A special case&mdash;accidental, of course!&rdquo; cried Alexandra and
      Adelaida.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me remind you once more, Evgenie,&rdquo; said Prince S., &ldquo;that your joke is
      getting a little threadbare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think about it, prince?&rdquo; asked Evgenie, taking no notice of
      the last remark, and observing Muishkin&rsquo;s serious eyes fixed upon his
      face. &ldquo;What do you think&mdash;was it a special or a usual case&mdash;the
      rule, or an exception? I confess I put the question especially for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think it was a special case,&rdquo; said the prince, quietly, but
      firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow!&rdquo; cried Prince S., with some annoyance, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you see
      that he is chaffing you? He is simply laughing at you, and wants to make
      game of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought Evgenie Pavlovitch was talking seriously,&rdquo; said the prince,
      blushing and dropping his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear prince,&rdquo; continued Prince S. &ldquo;remember what you and I were saying
      two or three months ago. We spoke of the fact that in our newly opened Law
      Courts one could already lay one&rsquo;s finger upon so many talented and
      remarkable young barristers. How pleased you were with the state of things
      as we found it, and how glad I was to observe your delight! We both said
      it was a matter to be proud of; but this clumsy defence that Evgenie
      mentions, this strange argument <i>can</i>, of course, only be an
      accidental case&mdash;one in a thousand!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince reflected a little, but very soon he replied, with absolute
      conviction in his tone, though he still spoke somewhat shyly and timidly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only wished to say that this &lsquo;distortion,&rsquo; as Evgenie Pavlovitch
      expressed it, is met with very often, and is far more the general rule
      than the exception, unfortunately for Russia. So much so, that if this
      distortion were not the general rule, perhaps these dreadful crimes would
      be less frequent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dreadful crimes? But I can assure you that crimes just as dreadful, and
      probably more horrible, have occurred before our times, and at all times,
      and not only here in Russia, but everywhere else as well. And in my
      opinion it is not at all likely that such murders will cease to occur for
      a very long time to come. The only difference is that in former times
      there was less publicity, while now everyone talks and writes freely about
      such things&mdash;which fact gives the impression that such crimes have
      only now sprung into existence. That is where your mistake lies&mdash;an
      extremely natural mistake, I assure you, my dear fellow!&rdquo; said Prince S.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that there were just as many, and just as terrible, crimes before
      our times. Not long since I visited a convict prison and made acquaintance
      with some of the criminals. There were some even more dreadful criminals
      than this one we have been speaking of&mdash;men who have murdered a dozen
      of their fellow-creatures, and feel no remorse whatever. But what I
      especially noticed was this, that the very most hopeless and remorseless
      murderer&mdash;however hardened a criminal he may be&mdash;still <i>knows
      that he is a criminal</i>; that is, he is conscious that he has acted
      wickedly, though he may feel no remorse whatever. And they were all like
      this. Those of whom Evgenie Pavlovitch has spoken, do not admit that they
      are criminals at all; they think they had a right to do what they did, and
      that they were even doing a good deed, perhaps. I consider there is the
      greatest difference between the two cases. And recollect&mdash;it was a <i>youth</i>,
      at the particular age which is most helplessly susceptible to the
      distortion of ideas!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Prince S. was now no longer smiling; he gazed at the prince in
      bewilderment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alexandra, who had seemed to wish to put in her word when the prince
      began, now sat silent, as though some sudden thought had caused her to
      change her mind about speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evgenie Pavlovitch gazed at him in real surprise, and this time his
      expression of face had no mockery in it whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you looking so surprised about, my friend?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Epanchin,
      suddenly. &ldquo;Did you suppose he was stupider than yourself, and was
      incapable of forming his own opinions, or what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! Oh no! Not at all!&rdquo; said Evgenie. &ldquo;But&mdash;how is it, prince, that
      you&mdash;(excuse the question, will you?)&mdash;if you are capable of
      observing and seeing things as you evidently do, how is it that you saw
      nothing distorted or perverted in that claim upon your property, which you
      acknowledged a day or two since; and which was full of arguments founded
      upon the most distorted views of right and wrong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what, my friend,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Epanchin, of a sudden, &ldquo;here
      are we all sitting here and imagining we are very clever, and perhaps
      laughing at the prince, some of us, and meanwhile he has received a letter
      this very day in which that same claimant renounces his claim, and begs
      the prince&rsquo;s pardon. There! <i>we</i> don&rsquo;t often get that sort of letter; and
      yet we are not ashamed to walk with our noses in the air before him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Hippolyte has come down here to stay,&rdquo; said Colia, suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! has he arrived?&rdquo; said the prince, starting up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I brought him down from town just after you had left the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There now! It&rsquo;s just like him,&rdquo; cried Lizabetha Prokofievna, boiling over
      once more, and entirely oblivious of the fact that she had just taken the
      prince&rsquo;s part. &ldquo;I dare swear that you went up to town yesterday on purpose
      to get the little wretch to do you the great honour of coming to stay at
      your house. You did go up to town, you know you did&mdash;you said so
      yourself! Now then, did you, or did you not, go down on your knees and beg
      him to come, confess!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he didn&rsquo;t, for I saw it all myself,&rdquo; said Colia. &ldquo;On the contrary,
      Hippolyte kissed his hand twice and thanked him; and all the prince said
      was that he thought Hippolyte might feel better here in the country!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Colia,&mdash;what is the use of saying all that?&rdquo; cried the
      prince, rising and taking his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going to now?&rdquo; cried Mrs. Epanchin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind about him now, prince,&rdquo; said Colia. &ldquo;He is all right and
      taking a nap after the journey. He is very happy to be here; but I think
      perhaps it would be better if you let him alone for today,&mdash;he is
      very sensitive now that he is so ill&mdash;and he might be embarrassed if
      you show him too much attention at first. He is decidedly better today,
      and says he has not felt so well for the last six months, and has coughed
      much less, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince observed that Aglaya came out of her corner and approached the
      table at this point.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not dare look at her, but he was conscious, to the very tips of his
      fingers, that she was gazing at him, perhaps angrily; and that she had
      probably flushed up with a look of fiery indignation in her black eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me, Mr. Colia, that you were very foolish to bring your young
      friend down&mdash;if he is the same consumptive boy who wept so profusely,
      and invited us all to his own funeral,&rdquo; remarked Evgenie Pavlovitch. &ldquo;He
      talked so eloquently about the blank wall outside his bedroom window, that
      I&rsquo;m sure he will never support life here without it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so too,&rdquo; said Mrs. Epanchin; &ldquo;he will quarrel with you, and be
      off,&rdquo; and she drew her workbox towards her with an air of dignity, quite
      oblivious of the fact that the family was about to start for a walk in the
      park.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I remember he boasted about the blank wall in an extraordinary way,&rdquo;
       continued Evgenie, &ldquo;and I feel that without that blank wall he will never
      be able to die eloquently; and he does so long to die eloquently!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you must forgive him the blank wall,&rdquo; said the prince, quietly. &ldquo;He
      has come down to see a few trees now, poor fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I forgive him with all my heart; you may tell him so if you like,&rdquo;
       laughed Evgenie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you should take it quite like that,&rdquo; said the prince,
      quietly, and without removing his eyes from the carpet. &ldquo;I think it is
      more a case of his forgiving you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgiving me! why so? What have I done to need his forgiveness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t understand, then&mdash;but of course, you do understand. He
      wished&mdash;he wished to bless you all round and to have your blessing&mdash;before
      he died&mdash;that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear prince,&rdquo; began Prince S., hurriedly, exchanging glances with some
      of those present, &ldquo;you will not easily find heaven on earth, and yet you
      seem to expect to. Heaven is a difficult thing to find anywhere, prince;
      far more difficult than appears to that good heart of yours. Better stop
      this conversation, or we shall all be growing quite disturbed in our
      minds, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go and hear the band, then,&rdquo; said Lizabetha Prokofievna, angrily
      rising from her place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest of the company followed her example.
    </p>
    <h3>
      II.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The prince suddenly approached Evgenie Pavlovitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Evgenie Pavlovitch,&rdquo; he said, with strange excitement and seizing the
      latter&rsquo;s hand in his own, &ldquo;be assured that I esteem you as a generous and
      honourable man, in spite of everything. Be assured of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Evgenie Pavlovitch fell back a step in astonishment. For one moment it was
      all he could do to restrain himself from bursting out laughing; but,
      looking closer, he observed that the prince did not seem to be quite
      himself; at all events, he was in a very curious state.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t mind betting, prince,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;that you did not in the
      least mean to say that, and very likely you meant to address someone else
      altogether. What is it? Are you feeling unwell or anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely, extremely likely, and you must be a very close observer to
      detect the fact that perhaps I did not intend to come up to <i>you</i> at
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying he smiled strangely; but suddenly and excitedly he began again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t remind me of what I have done or said. Don&rsquo;t! I am very much
      ashamed of myself, I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what have you done? I don&rsquo;t understand you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see you are ashamed of me, Evgenie Pavlovitch; you are blushing for me;
      that&rsquo;s a sign of a good heart. Don&rsquo;t be afraid; I shall go away directly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with him? Do his fits begin like that?&rdquo; said Lizabetha
      Prokofievna, in a high state of alarm, addressing Colia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, Lizabetha Prokofievna, take no notice of me. I am not going to
      have a fit. I will go away directly; but I know I am afflicted. I was
      twenty-four years an invalid, you see&mdash;the first twenty-four years of
      my life&mdash;so take all I do and say as the sayings and actions of an
      invalid. I&rsquo;m going away directly, I really am&mdash;don&rsquo;t be afraid. I am
      not blushing, for I don&rsquo;t think I need blush about it, need I? But I see
      that I am out of place in society&mdash;society is better without me. It&rsquo;s
      not vanity, I assure you. I have thought over it all these last three
      days, and I have made up my mind that I ought to unbosom myself candidly
      before you at the first opportunity. There are certain things, certain
      great ideas, which I must not so much as approach, as Prince S. has just
      reminded me, or I shall make you all laugh. I have no sense of proportion,
      I know; my words and gestures do not express my ideas&mdash;they are a
      humiliation and abasement of the ideas, and therefore, I have no right&mdash;and
      I am too sensitive. Still, I believe I am beloved in this household, and
      esteemed far more than I deserve. But I can&rsquo;t help knowing that after
      twenty-four years of illness there must be some trace left, so that it is
      impossible for people to refrain from laughing at me sometimes; don&rsquo;t you
      think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to pause for a reply, for some verdict, as it were, and looked
      humbly around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      All present stood rooted to the earth with amazement at this unexpected
      and apparently uncalled-for outbreak; but the poor prince&rsquo;s painful and
      rambling speech gave rise to a strange episode.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you say all this here?&rdquo; cried Aglaya, suddenly. &ldquo;Why do you talk
      like this to <i>them?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She appeared to be in the last stages of wrath and irritation; her eyes
      flashed. The prince stood dumbly and blindly before her, and suddenly grew
      pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is not one of them all who is worthy of these words of yours,&rdquo;
       continued Aglaya. &ldquo;Not one of them is worth your little finger, not one of
      them has heart or head to compare with yours! You are more honest than
      all, and better, nobler, kinder, wiser than all. There are some here who
      are unworthy to bend and pick up the handkerchief you have just dropped.
      Why do you humiliate yourself like this, and place yourself lower than
      these people? Why do you debase yourself before them? Why have you no
      pride?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God! Who would ever have believed this?&rdquo; cried Mrs. Epanchin, wringing
      her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurrah for the &lsquo;poor knight&rsquo;!&rdquo; cried Colia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be quiet! How dare they laugh at me in your house?&rdquo; said Aglaya, turning
      sharply on her mother in that hysterical frame of mind that rides
      recklessly over every obstacle and plunges blindly through proprieties.
      &ldquo;Why does everyone, everyone worry and torment me? Why have they all been
      bullying me these three days about you, prince? I will not marry you&mdash;never,
      and under no circumstances! Know that once and for all; as if anyone could
      marry an absurd creature like you! Just look in the glass and see what you
      look like, this very moment! Why, <i>why</i> do they torment me and say I
      am going to marry you? You must know it; you are in the plot with them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one ever tormented you on the subject,&rdquo; murmured Adelaida, aghast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one ever thought of such a thing! There has never been a word said
      about it!&rdquo; cried Alexandra.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who has been annoying her? Who has been tormenting the child? Who could
      have said such a thing to her? Is she raving?&rdquo; cried Lizabetha
      Prokofievna, trembling with rage, to the company in general.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every one of them has been saying it&mdash;every one of them&mdash;all
      these three days! And I will never, never marry him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Aglaya burst into bitter tears, and, hiding her face in her
      handkerchief, sank back into a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he has never even&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never asked you to marry me, Aglaya Ivanovna!&rdquo; said the prince, of
      a sudden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>What?</i>&rdquo; cried Mrs. Epanchin, raising her hands in horror. &ldquo;<i>What&rsquo;s</i>
      that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She could not believe her ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I meant to say&mdash;I only meant to say,&rdquo; said the prince, faltering, &ldquo;I
      merely meant to explain to Aglaya Ivanovna&mdash;to have the honour to
      explain, as it were&mdash;that I had no intention&mdash;never had&mdash;to
      ask the honour of her hand. I assure you I am not guilty, Aglaya Ivanovna,
      I am not, indeed. I never did wish to&mdash;I never thought of it at all&mdash;and
      never shall&mdash;you&rsquo;ll see it yourself&mdash;you may be quite assured of
      it. Some wicked person has been maligning me to you; but it&rsquo;s all right.
      Don&rsquo;t worry about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, the prince approached Aglaya.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took the handkerchief from her face, glanced keenly at him, took in
      what he had said, and burst out laughing&mdash;such a merry, unrestrained
      laugh, so hearty and gay, that Adelaida could not contain herself. She,
      too, glanced at the prince&rsquo;s panic-stricken countenance, then rushed at
      her sister, threw her arms round her neck, and burst into as merry a fit
      of laughter as Aglaya&rsquo;s own. They laughed together like a couple of
      school-girls. Hearing and seeing this, the prince smiled happily, and in
      accents of relief and joy, he exclaimed &ldquo;Well, thank God&mdash;thank God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alexandra now joined in, and it looked as though the three sisters were
      going to laugh on for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are insane,&rdquo; muttered Lizabetha Prokofievna. &ldquo;Either they frighten
      one out of one&rsquo;s wits, or else&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Prince S. was laughing now, too, so was Evgenie Pavlovitch, so was
      Colia, and so was the prince himself, who caught the infection as he
      looked round radiantly upon the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along, let&rsquo;s go out for a walk!&rdquo; cried Adelaida. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll all go
      together, and the prince must absolutely go with us. You needn&rsquo;t go away,
      you dear good fellow! <i>Isn&rsquo;t</i> he a dear, Aglaya? Isn&rsquo;t he, mother? I
      must really give him a kiss for&mdash;for his explanation to Aglaya just
      now. Mother, dear, I may kiss him, mayn&rsquo;t I? Aglaya, may I kiss <i>your</i>
      prince?&rdquo; cried the young rogue, and sure enough she skipped up to the
      prince and kissed his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seized her hands, and pressed them so hard that Adelaida nearly cried
      out; he then gazed with delight into her eyes, and raising her right hand
      to his lips with enthusiasm, kissed it three times.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along,&rdquo; said Aglaya. &ldquo;Prince, you must walk with me. May he, mother?
      This young cavalier, who won&rsquo;t have me? You said you would <i>never</i>
      have me, didn&rsquo;t you, prince? No&mdash;no, not like that; <i>that&rsquo;s</i> not
      the way to give your arm. Don&rsquo;t you know how to give your arm to a lady
      yet? There&mdash;so. Now, come along, you and I will lead the way. Would
      you like to lead the way with me alone, tête-à-tête?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went on talking and chatting without a pause, with occasional little
      bursts of laughter between.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God&mdash;thank God!&rdquo; said Lizabetha Prokofievna to herself,
      without quite knowing why she felt so relieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What extraordinary people they are!&rdquo; thought Prince S., for perhaps the
      hundredth time since he had entered into intimate relations with the
      family; but&mdash;he liked these &ldquo;extraordinary people,&rdquo; all the same. As
      for Prince Lef Nicolaievitch himself, Prince S. did not seem quite to like
      him, somehow. He was decidedly preoccupied and a little disturbed as they
      all started off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evgenie Pavlovitch seemed to be in a lively humour. He made Adelaida and
      Alexandra laugh all the way to the Vauxhall; but they both laughed so very
      readily and promptly that the worthy Evgenie began at last to suspect that
      they were not listening to him at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this idea, he burst out laughing all at once, in quite unaffected
      mirth, and without giving any explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sisters, who also appeared to be in high spirits, never tired of
      glancing at Aglaya and the prince, who were walking in front. It was
      evident that their younger sister was a thorough puzzle to them both.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prince S. tried hard to get up a conversation with Mrs. Epanchin upon
      outside subjects, probably with the good intention of distracting and
      amusing her; but he bored her dreadfully. She was absent-minded to a
      degree, and answered at cross purposes, and sometimes not at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the puzzle and mystery of Aglaya was not yet over for the evening. The
      last exhibition fell to the lot of the prince alone. When they had
      proceeded some hundred paces or so from the house, Aglaya said to her
      obstinately silent cavalier in a quick half-whisper:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look to the right!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince glanced in the direction indicated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look closer. Do you see that bench, in the park there, just by those
      three big trees&mdash;that green bench?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince replied that he saw it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you like the position of it? Sometimes of a morning early, at seven
      o&rsquo;clock, when all the rest are still asleep, I come out and sit there
      alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince muttered that the spot was a lovely one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, go away, I don&rsquo;t wish to have your arm any longer; or perhaps,
      better, continue to give me your arm, and walk along beside me, but don&rsquo;t
      speak a word to me. I wish to think by myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The warning was certainly unnecessary; for the prince would not have said
      a word all the rest of the time whether forbidden to speak or not. His
      heart beat loud and painfully when Aglaya spoke of the bench; could she&mdash;but
      no! he banished the thought, after an instant&rsquo;s deliberation.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Pavlofsk, on weekdays, the public is more select than it is on Sundays
      and Saturdays, when the townsfolk come down to walk about and enjoy the
      park.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ladies dress elegantly, on these days, and it is the fashion to gather
      round the band, which is probably the best of our pleasure-garden bands,
      and plays the newest pieces. The behaviour of the public is most correct
      and proper, and there is an appearance of friendly intimacy among the
      usual frequenters. Many come for nothing but to look at their
      acquaintances, but there are others who come for the sake of the music. It
      is very seldom that anything happens to break the harmony of the
      proceedings, though, of course, accidents will happen everywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this particular evening the weather was lovely, and there were a large
      number of people present. All the places anywhere near the orchestra were
      occupied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our friends took chairs near the side exit. The crowd and the music
      cheered Mrs. Epanchin a little, and amused the girls; they bowed and shook
      hands with some of their friends and nodded at a distance to others; they
      examined the ladies&rsquo; dresses, noticed comicalities and eccentricities
      among the people, and laughed and talked among themselves. Evgenie
      Pavlovitch, too, found plenty of friends to bow to. Several people noticed
      Aglaya and the prince, who were still together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before very long two or three young men had come up, and one or two
      remained to talk; all of these young men appeared to be on intimate terms
      with Evgenie Pavlovitch. Among them was a young officer, a remarkably
      handsome fellow&mdash;very good-natured and a great chatterbox. He tried
      to get up a conversation with Aglaya, and did his best to secure her
      attention. Aglaya behaved very graciously to him, and chatted and laughed
      merrily. Evgenie Pavlovitch begged the prince&rsquo;s leave to introduce their
      friend to him. The prince hardly realized what was wanted of him, but the
      introduction came off; the two men bowed and shook hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evgenie Pavlovitch&rsquo;s friend asked the prince some question, but the latter
      did not reply, or if he did, he muttered something so strangely indistinct
      that there was nothing to be made of it. The officer stared intently at
      him, then glanced at Evgenie, divined why the latter had introduced him,
      and gave his undivided attention to Aglaya again. Only Evgenie Pavlovitch
      observed that Aglaya flushed up for a moment at this.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince did not notice that others were talking and making themselves
      agreeable to Aglaya; in fact, at moments, he almost forgot that he was
      sitting by her himself. At other moments he felt a longing to go away
      somewhere and be alone with his thoughts, and to feel that no one knew
      where he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or if that were impossible he would like to be alone at home, on the
      terrace&mdash;without either Lebedeff or his children, or anyone else about him,
      and to lie there and think&mdash;a day and night and another day again! He
      thought of the mountains&mdash;and especially of a certain spot which he
      used to frequent, whence he would look down upon the distant valleys and
      fields, and see the waterfall, far off, like a little silver thread, and
      the old ruined castle in the distance. Oh! how he longed to be there now&mdash;alone
      with his thoughts&mdash;to think of one thing all his life&mdash;one
      thing! A thousand years would not be too much time! And let everyone here
      forget him&mdash;forget him utterly! How much better it would have been if
      they had never known him&mdash;if all this could but prove to be a dream.
      Perhaps it was a dream!
    </p>
    <p>
      Now and then he looked at Aglaya for five minutes at a time, without
      taking his eyes off her face; but his expression was very strange; he
      would gaze at her as though she were an object a couple of miles distant,
      or as though he were looking at her portrait and not at herself at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you look at me like that, prince?&rdquo; she asked suddenly, breaking
      off her merry conversation and laughter with those about her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid
      of you! You look as though you were just going to put out your hand and
      touch my face to see if it&rsquo;s real! Doesn&rsquo;t he, Evgenie Pavlovitch&mdash;doesn&rsquo;t
      he look like that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince seemed surprised that he should have been addressed at all; he
      reflected a moment, but did not seem to take in what had been said to him;
      at all events, he did not answer. But observing that she and the others
      had begun to laugh, he too opened his mouth and laughed with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The laughter became general, and the young officer, who seemed a
      particularly lively sort of person, simply shook with mirth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aglaya suddenly whispered angrily to herself the word&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Idiot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My goodness&mdash;surely she is not in love with such a&mdash;surely she
      isn&rsquo;t mad!&rdquo; groaned Mrs. Epanchin, under her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all a joke, mamma; it&rsquo;s just a joke like the &lsquo;poor knight&rsquo;&mdash;nothing
      more whatever, I assure you!&rdquo; Alexandra whispered in her ear. &ldquo;She is
      chaffing him&mdash;making a fool of him, after her own private fashion,
      that&rsquo;s all! But she carries it just a little too far&mdash;she is a
      regular little actress. How she frightened us just now&mdash;didn&rsquo;t she?&mdash;and
      all for a lark!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s lucky she has happened upon an idiot, then, that&rsquo;s all I can
      say!&rdquo; whispered Lizabetha Prokofievna, who was somewhat comforted,
      however, by her daughter&rsquo;s remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince had heard himself referred to as &ldquo;idiot,&rdquo; and had shuddered at
      the moment; but his shudder, it so happened, was not caused by the word
      applied to him. The fact was that in the crowd, not far from where he was
      sitting, a pale familiar face, with curly black hair, and a well-known
      smile and expression, had flashed across his vision for a moment, and
      disappeared again. Very likely he had imagined it! There only remained to
      him the impression of a strange smile, two eyes, and a bright green tie.
      Whether the man had disappeared among the crowd, or whether he had turned
      towards the Vauxhall, the prince could not say.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a moment or two afterwards he began to glance keenly about him. That
      first vision might only too likely be the forerunner of a second; it was
      almost certain to be so. Surely he had not forgotten the possibility of
      such a meeting when he came to the Vauxhall? True enough, he had not
      remarked where he was coming to when he set out with Aglaya; he had not
      been in a condition to remark anything at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had he been more careful to observe his companion, he would have seen that
      for the last quarter of an hour Aglaya had also been glancing around in
      apparent anxiety, as though she expected to see someone, or something
      particular, among the crowd of people. Now, at the moment when his own
      anxiety became so marked, her excitement also increased visibly, and when
      he looked about him, she did the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reason for their anxiety soon became apparent. From that very side
      entrance to the Vauxhall, near which the prince and all the Epanchin party
      were seated, there suddenly appeared quite a large knot of persons, at
      least a dozen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heading this little band walked three ladies, two of whom were remarkably
      lovely; and there was nothing surprising in the fact that they should have
      had a large troop of admirers following in their wake.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was something in the appearance of both the ladies and their
      admirers which was peculiar, quite different for that of the rest of the
      public assembled around the orchestra.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearly everyone observed the little band advancing, and all pretended not
      to see or notice them, except a few young fellows who exchanged glances
      and smiled, saying something to one another in whispers.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was impossible to avoid noticing them, however, in reality, for they
      made their presence only too conspicuous by laughing and talking loudly.
      It was to be supposed that some of them were more than half drunk,
      although they were well enough dressed, some even particularly well. There
      were one or two, however, who were very strange-looking creatures, with
      flushed faces and extraordinary clothes; some were military men; not all
      were quite young; one or two were middle-aged gentlemen of decidedly
      disagreeable appearance, men who are avoided in society like the plague,
      decked out in large gold studs and rings, and magnificently &ldquo;got up,&rdquo;
       generally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among our suburban resorts there are some which enjoy a specially high
      reputation for respectability and fashion; but the most careful individual
      is not absolutely exempt from the danger of a tile falling suddenly upon
      his head from his neighbour&rsquo;s roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a tile was about to descend upon the elegant and decorous public now
      assembled to hear the music.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to pass from the Vauxhall to the band-stand, the visitor has to
      descend two or three steps. Just at these steps the group paused, as
      though it feared to proceed further; but very quickly one of the three
      ladies, who formed its apex, stepped forward into the charmed circle,
      followed by two members of her suite.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of these was a middle-aged man of very respectable appearance, but
      with the stamp of parvenu upon him, a man whom nobody knew, and who
      evidently knew nobody. The other follower was younger and far less
      respectable-looking.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one else followed the eccentric lady; but as she descended the steps
      she did not even look behind her, as though it were absolutely the same to
      her whether anyone were following or not. She laughed and talked loudly,
      however, just as before. She was dressed with great taste, but with rather
      more magnificence than was needed for the occasion, perhaps.
    </p>
    <p>
      She walked past the orchestra, to where an open carriage was waiting, near
      the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince had not seen <i>her</i> for more than three months. All these
      days since his arrival from Petersburg he had intended to pay her a visit,
      but some mysterious presentiment had restrained him. He could not picture
      to himself what impression this meeting with her would make upon him,
      though he had often tried to imagine it, with fear and trembling. One fact
      was quite certain, and that was that the meeting would be painful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several times during the last six months he had recalled the effect which
      the first sight of this face had had upon him, when he only saw its
      portrait. He recollected well that even the portrait face had left but too
      painful an impression.
    </p>
    <p>
      That month in the provinces, when he had seen this woman nearly every day,
      had affected him so deeply that he could not now look back upon it calmly.
      In the very look of this woman there was something which tortured him. In
      conversation with Rogojin he had attributed this sensation to pity&mdash;immeasurable
      pity, and this was the truth. The sight of the portrait face alone had
      filled his heart full of the agony of real sympathy; and this feeling of
      sympathy, nay, of actual <i>suffering</i>, for her, had never left his
      heart since that hour, and was still in full force. Oh yes, and more
      powerful than ever!
    </p>
    <p>
      But the prince was not satisfied with what he had said to Rogojin. Only at
      this moment, when she suddenly made her appearance before him, did he
      realize to the full the exact emotion which she called up in him, and
      which he had not described correctly to Rogojin.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, indeed, there were no words in which he could have expressed his
      horror, yes, <i>horror</i>, for he was now fully convinced from his own
      private knowledge of her, that the woman was mad.
    </p>
    <p>
      If, loving a woman above everything in the world, or at least having a
      foretaste of the possibility of such love for her, one were suddenly to
      behold her on a chain, behind bars and under the lash of a keeper, one
      would feel something like what the poor prince now felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Aglaya, in a whisper, giving his sleeve a
      little tug.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned his head towards her and glanced at her black and (for some
      reason) flashing eyes, tried to smile, and then, apparently forgetting her
      in an instant, turned to the right once more, and continued to watch the
      startling apparition before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nastasia Philipovna was at this moment passing the young ladies&rsquo; chairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evgenie Pavlovitch continued some apparently extremely funny and
      interesting anecdote to Alexandra, speaking quickly and with much
      animation. The prince remembered that at this moment Aglaya remarked in a
      half-whisper:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>What</i> a&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not finish her indefinite sentence; she restrained herself in a
      moment; but it was enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nastasia Philipovna, who up to now had been walking along as though she
      had not noticed the Epanchin party, suddenly turned her head in their
      direction, as though she had just observed Evgenie Pavlovitch sitting
      there for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I declare, here he is!&rdquo; she cried, stopping suddenly. &ldquo;The man one
      can&rsquo;t find with all one&rsquo;s messengers sent about the place, sitting just
      under one&rsquo;s nose, exactly where one never thought of looking! I thought
      you were sure to be at your uncle&rsquo;s by this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Evgenie Pavlovitch flushed up and looked angrily at Nastasia Philipovna,
      then turned his back on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! don&rsquo;t you know about it yet? He doesn&rsquo;t know&mdash;imagine that!
      Why, he&rsquo;s shot himself. Your uncle shot himself this very morning. I was
      told at two this afternoon. Half the town must know it by now. They say
      there are three hundred and fifty thousand roubles, government money,
      missing; some say five hundred thousand. And I was under the impression
      that he would leave you a fortune! He&rsquo;s whistled it all away. A most
      depraved old gentleman, really! Well, ta, ta!&mdash;bonne chance! Surely
      you intend to be off there, don&rsquo;t you? Ha, ha! You&rsquo;ve retired from the
      army in good time, I see! Plain clothes! Well done, sly rogue! Nonsense! I
      see&mdash;you knew it all before&mdash;I dare say you knew all about it
      yesterday-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Although the impudence of this attack, this public proclamation of
      intimacy, as it were, was doubtless premeditated, and had its special
      object, yet Evgenie Pavlovitch at first seemed to intend to make no show
      of observing either his tormentor or her words. But Nastasia&rsquo;s
      communication struck him with the force of a thunderclap. On hearing of
      his uncle&rsquo;s death he suddenly grew as white as a sheet, and turned towards
      his informant.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, Lizabetha Prokofievna rose swiftly from her seat, beckoned
      her companions, and left the place almost at a run.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only the prince stopped behind for a moment, as though in indecision; and
      Evgenie Pavlovitch lingered too, for he had not collected his scattered
      wits. But the Epanchins had not had time to get more than twenty paces
      away when a scandalous episode occurred. The young officer, Evgenie
      Pavlovitch&rsquo;s friend who had been conversing with Aglaya, said aloud in a
      great state of indignation:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She ought to be whipped&mdash;that&rsquo;s the only way to deal with creatures
      like that&mdash;she ought to be whipped!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This gentleman was a confidant of Evgenie&rsquo;s, and had doubtless heard of
      the carriage episode.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nastasia turned to him. Her eyes flashed; she rushed up to a young man
      standing near, whom she did not know in the least, but who happened to
      have in his hand a thin cane. Seizing this from him, she brought it with
      all her force across the face of her insulter.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this occurred, of course, in one instant of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young officer, forgetting himself, sprang towards her. Nastasia&rsquo;s
      followers were not by her at the moment (the elderly gentleman having
      disappeared altogether, and the younger man simply standing aside and
      roaring with laughter).
    </p>
    <p>
      In another moment, of course, the police would have been on the spot, and
      it would have gone hard with Nastasia Philipovna had not unexpected aid
      appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Muishkin, who was but a couple of steps away, had time to spring forward
      and seize the officer&rsquo;s arms from behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The officer, tearing himself from the prince&rsquo;s grasp, pushed him so
      violently backwards that he staggered a few steps and then subsided into a
      chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there were other defenders for Nastasia on the spot by this time. The
      gentleman known as the &ldquo;boxer&rdquo; now confronted the enraged officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keller is my name, sir; ex-lieutenant,&rdquo; he said, very loud. &ldquo;If you will
      accept me as champion of the fair sex, I am at your disposal. English
      boxing has no secrets from me. I sympathize with you for the insult you
      have received, but I can&rsquo;t permit you to raise your hand against a woman
      in public. If you prefer to meet me&mdash;as would be more fitting to your
      rank&mdash;in some other manner, of course you understand me, captain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the young officer had recovered himself, and was no longer listening.
      At this moment Rogojin appeared, elbowing through the crowd; he took
      Nastasia&rsquo;s hand, drew it through his arm, and quickly led her away. He
      appeared to be terribly excited; he was trembling all over, and was as
      pale as a corpse. As he carried Nastasia off, he turned and grinned
      horribly in the officer&rsquo;s face, and with low malice observed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tfu! look what the fellow got! Look at the blood on his cheek! Ha, ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Recollecting himself, however, and seeing at a glance the sort of people
      he had to deal with, the officer turned his back on both his opponents,
      and courteously, but concealing his face with his handkerchief, approached
      the prince, who was now rising from the chair into which he had fallen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prince Muishkin, I believe? The gentleman to whom I had the honour of
      being introduced?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is mad, insane&mdash;I assure you, she is mad,&rdquo; replied the prince in
      trembling tones, holding out both his hands mechanically towards the
      officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot boast of any such knowledge, of course, but I wished to know
      your name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bowed and retired without waiting for an answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five seconds after the disappearance of the last actor in this scene, the
      police arrived. The whole episode had not lasted more than a couple of
      minutes. Some of the spectators had risen from their places, and departed
      altogether; some merely exchanged their seats for others a little further
      off; some were delighted with the occurrence, and talked and laughed over
      it for a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a word, the incident closed as such incidents do, and the band began to
      play again. The prince walked away after the Epanchin party. Had he
      thought of looking round to the left after he had been pushed so
      unceremoniously into the chair, he would have observed Aglaya standing
      some twenty yards away. She had stayed to watch the scandalous scene in
      spite of her mother&rsquo;s and sisters&rsquo; anxious cries to her to come away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prince S. ran up to her and persuaded her, at last, to come home with
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lizabetha Prokofievna saw that she returned in such a state of agitation
      that it was doubtful whether she had even heard their calls. But only a
      couple of minutes later, when they had reached the park, Aglaya suddenly
      remarked, in her usual calm, indifferent voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted to see how the farce would end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <h3>
      III.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The occurrence at the Vauxhall had filled both mother and daughters with
      something like horror. In their excitement Lizabetha Prokofievna and the
      girls were nearly running all the way home.
    </p>
    <p>
      In her opinion there was so much disclosed and laid bare by the episode,
      that, in spite of the chaotic condition of her mind, she was able to feel
      more or less decided on certain points which, up to now, had been in a
      cloudy condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, one and all of the party realized that something important had
      happened, and that, perhaps fortunately enough, something which had
      hitherto been enveloped in the obscurity of guess-work had now begun to
      come forth a little from the mists. In spite of Prince S.&lsquo;s assurances and
      explanations, Evgenie Pavlovitch&rsquo;s real character and position were at
      last coming to light. He was publicly convicted of intimacy with &ldquo;that
      creature.&rdquo; So thought Lizabetha Prokofievna and her two elder daughters.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the real upshot of the business was that the number of riddles to be
      solved was augmented. The two girls, though rather irritated at their
      mother&rsquo;s exaggerated alarm and haste to depart from the scene, had been
      unwilling to worry her at first with questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, they could not help thinking that their sister Aglaya probably
      knew more about the whole matter than both they and their mother put
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prince S. looked as black as night, and was silent and moody. Mrs.
      Epanchin did not say a word to him all the way home, and he did not seem
      to observe the fact. Adelaida tried to pump him a little by asking, &ldquo;who
      was the uncle they were talking about, and what was it that had happened
      in Petersburg?&rdquo; But he had merely muttered something disconnected about
      &ldquo;making inquiries,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;of course it was all nonsense.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, of
      course,&rdquo; replied Adelaida, and asked no more questions. Aglaya, too, was
      very quiet; and the only remark she made on the way home was that they
      were &ldquo;walking much too fast to be pleasant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once she turned and observed the prince hurrying after them. Noticing his
      anxiety to catch them up, she smiled ironically, and then looked back no
      more. At length, just as they neared the house, General Epanchin came out
      and met them; he had only just arrived from town.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first word was to inquire after Evgenie Pavlovitch. But Lizabetha
      stalked past him, and neither looked at him nor answered his question.
    </p>
    <p>
      He immediately judged from the faces of his daughters and Prince S. that
      there was a thunderstorm brewing, and he himself already bore evidences of
      unusual perturbation of mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      He immediately button-holed Prince S., and standing at the front door,
      engaged in a whispered conversation with him. By the troubled aspect of
      both of them, when they entered the house, and approached Mrs. Epanchin,
      it was evident that they had been discussing very disturbing news.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little by little the family gathered together upstairs in Lizabetha
      Prokofievna&rsquo;s apartments, and Prince Muishkin found himself alone on the
      verandah when he arrived. He settled himself in a corner and sat waiting,
      though he knew not what he expected. It never struck him that he had
      better go away, with all this disturbance in the house. He seemed to have
      forgotten all the world, and to be ready to sit on where he was for years
      on end. From upstairs he caught sounds of excited conversation every now
      and then.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not say how long he sat there. It grew late and became quite
      dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Aglaya entered the verandah. She seemed to be quite calm, though
      a little pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Observing the prince, whom she evidently did not expect to see there,
      alone in the corner, she smiled, and approached him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing there?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince muttered something, blushed, and jumped up; but Aglaya
      immediately sat down beside him; so he reseated himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked suddenly, but attentively into his face, then at the window, as
      though thinking of something else, and then again at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps she wants to laugh at me,&rdquo; thought the prince, &ldquo;but no; for if
      she did she certainly would do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you like some tea? I&rsquo;ll order some,&rdquo; she said, after a minute or
      two of silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N-no thanks, I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know! How can you not know? By-the-by, look here&mdash;if someone
      were to challenge you to a duel, what should you do? I wished to ask you
      this&mdash;some time ago&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? Nobody would ever challenge me to a duel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if they were to, would you be dreadfully frightened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say I should be&mdash;much alarmed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seriously? Then are you a coward?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N-no!&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think so. A coward is a man who is afraid and runs
      away; the man who is frightened but does not run away, is not quite a
      coward,&rdquo; said the prince with a smile, after a moment&rsquo;s thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you wouldn&rsquo;t run away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think I should run away,&rdquo; replied the prince, laughing
      outright at last at Aglaya&rsquo;s questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Though I am a woman, I should certainly not run away for anything,&rdquo; said
      Aglaya, in a slightly pained voice. &ldquo;However, I see you are laughing at me
      and twisting your face up as usual in order to make yourself look more
      interesting. Now tell me, they generally shoot at twenty paces, don&rsquo;t
      they? At ten, sometimes? I suppose if at ten they must be either wounded
      or killed, mustn&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think they often kill each other at duels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They killed Pushkin that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may have been an accident.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit of it; it was a duel to the death, and he was killed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bullet struck so low down that probably his antagonist would never
      have aimed at that part of him&mdash;people never do; he would have aimed
      at his chest or head; so that probably the bullet hit him accidentally. I
      have been told this by competent authorities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, a soldier once told me that they were always ordered to aim at the
      middle of the body. So you see they don&rsquo;t aim at the chest or head; they
      aim lower on purpose. I asked some officer about this afterwards, and he
      said it was perfectly true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is probably when they fire from a long distance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you shoot at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I have never shot in my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you even load a pistol?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! That is, I understand how it&rsquo;s done, of course, but I have never done
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, you don&rsquo;t know how, for it is a matter that needs practice. Now
      listen and learn; in the first place buy good powder, not damp (they say
      it mustn&rsquo;t be at all damp, but very dry), some fine kind it is&mdash;you
      must ask for <i>pistol</i> powder, not the stuff they load cannons with.
      They say one makes the bullets oneself, somehow or other. Have you got a
      pistol?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t want one,&rdquo; said the prince, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, what <i>nonsense!</i> You must buy one. French or English are the
      best, they say. Then take a little powder, about a thimbleful, or perhaps
      two, and pour it into the barrel. Better put plenty. Then push in a bit of
      felt (it <i>must</i> be felt, for some reason or other); you can easily
      get a bit off some old mattress, or off a door; it&rsquo;s used to keep the cold
      out. Well, when you have pushed the felt down, put the bullet in; do you
      hear now? The bullet last and the powder first, not the other way, or the
      pistol won&rsquo;t shoot. What are you laughing at? I wish you to buy a pistol
      and practise every day, and you must learn to hit a mark for <i>certain</i>;
      will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince only laughed. Aglaya stamped her foot with annoyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her serious air, however, during this conversation had surprised him
      considerably. He had a feeling that he ought to be asking her something,
      that there was something he wanted to find out far more important than how
      to load a pistol; but his thoughts had all scattered, and he was only
      aware that she was sitting by him, and talking to him, and that he was
      looking at her; as to what she happened to be saying to him, that did not
      matter in the least.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general now appeared on the verandah, coming from upstairs. He was on
      his way out, with an expression of determination on his face, and of
      preoccupation and worry also.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Lef Nicolaievitch, it&rsquo;s you, is it? Where are you off to now?&rdquo; he
      asked, oblivious of the fact that the prince had not showed the least sign
      of moving. &ldquo;Come along with me; I want to say a word or two to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Au revoir</i>, then!&rdquo; said Aglaya, holding out her hand to the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was quite dark now, and Muishkin could not see her face clearly, but a
      minute or two later, when he and the general had left the villa, he
      suddenly flushed up, and squeezed his right hand tightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It appeared that he and the general were going in the same direction. In
      spite of the lateness of the hour, the general was hurrying away to talk
      to someone upon some important subject. Meanwhile he talked incessantly
      but disconnectedly to the prince, and continually brought in the name of
      Lizabetha Prokofievna.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the prince had been in a condition to pay more attention to what the
      general was saying, he would have discovered that the latter was desirous
      of drawing some information out of him, or indeed of asking him some
      question outright; but that he could not make up his mind to come to the
      point.
    </p>
    <p>
      Muishkin was so absent, that from the very first he could not attend to a
      word the other was saying; and when the general suddenly stopped before
      him with some excited question, he was obliged to confess, ignominiously,
      that he did not know in the least what he had been talking about.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How strange everyone, yourself included, has become of late,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I
      was telling you that I cannot in the least understand Lizabetha
      Prokofievna&rsquo;s ideas and agitations. She is in hysterics up there, and
      moans and says that we have been &lsquo;shamed and disgraced.&rsquo; How? Why? When?
      By whom? I confess that I am very much to blame myself; I do not conceal
      the fact; but the conduct, the outrageous behaviour of this woman, must
      really be kept within limits, by the police if necessary, and I am just on
      my way now to talk the question over and make some arrangements. It can
      all be managed quietly and gently, even kindly, and without the slightest
      fuss or scandal. I foresee that the future is pregnant with events, and
      that there is much that needs explanation. There is intrigue in the wind;
      but if on one side nothing is known, on the other side nothing will be
      explained. If I have heard nothing about it, nor have <i>you</i>, nor <i>he</i>,
      nor <i>she</i>&mdash;who <i>has</i> heard about it, I should like to know?
      How <i>can</i> all this be explained except by the fact that half of it is
      mirage or moonshine, or some hallucination of that sort?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>She</i> is insane,&rdquo; muttered the prince, suddenly recollecting all
      that had passed, with a spasm of pain at his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I too had that idea, and I slept in peace. But now I see that their
      opinion is more correct. I do not believe in the theory of madness! The
      woman has no common sense; but she is not only not insane, she is artful
      to a degree. Her outburst of this evening about Evgenie&rsquo;s uncle proves
      that conclusively. It was <i>villainous</i>, simply jesuitical, and it was
      all for some special purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about Evgenie&rsquo;s uncle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My goodness, Lef Nicolaievitch, why, you can&rsquo;t have heard a single word I
      said! Look at me, I&rsquo;m still trembling all over with the dreadful shock! It
      is that that kept me in town so late. Evgenie Pavlovitch&rsquo;s uncle&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; cried the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shot himself this morning, at seven o&rsquo;clock. A respected, eminent old man
      of seventy; and exactly point for point as she described it; a sum of
      money, a considerable sum of government money, missing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, how could she&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, know of it? Ha, ha, ha! Why, there was a whole crowd round her the
      moment she appeared on the scenes here. You know what sort of people
      surround her nowadays, and solicit the honour of her &lsquo;acquaintance.&rsquo; Of
      course she might easily have heard the news from someone coming from town.
      All Petersburg, if not all Pavlofsk, knows it by now. Look at the slyness
      of her observation about Evgenie&rsquo;s uniform! I mean, her remark that he had
      retired just in time! There&rsquo;s a venomous hint for you, if you like! No,
      no! there&rsquo;s no insanity there! Of course I refuse to believe that Evgenie
      Pavlovitch could have known beforehand of the catastrophe; that is, that
      at such and such a day at seven o&rsquo;clock, and all that; but he might well
      have had a presentiment of the truth. And I&mdash;all of us&mdash;Prince
      S. and everybody, believed that he was to inherit a large fortune from
      this uncle. It&rsquo;s dreadful, horrible! Mind, I don&rsquo;t suspect Evgenie of
      anything, be quite clear on that point; but the thing is a little
      suspicious, nevertheless. Prince S. can&rsquo;t get over it. Altogether it is a
      very extraordinary combination of circumstances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What suspicion attaches to Evgenie Pavlovitch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, none at all! He has behaved very well indeed. I didn&rsquo;t mean to drop
      any sort of hint. His own fortune is intact, I believe. Lizabetha
      Prokofievna, of course, refuses to listen to anything. That&rsquo;s the worst of
      it all, these family catastrophes or quarrels, or whatever you like to
      call them. You know, prince, you are a friend of the family, so I don&rsquo;t
      mind telling you; it now appears that Evgenie Pavlovitch proposed to
      Aglaya a month ago, and was refused.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; cried the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? Do you know anything about it? Look here,&rdquo; continued the general,
      more agitated than ever, and trembling with excitement, &ldquo;maybe I have been
      letting the cat out of the bag too freely with you, if so, it is because
      you are&mdash;that sort of man, you know! Perhaps you have some special
      information?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing about Evgenie Pavlovitch!&rdquo; said the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor do I! They always try to bury me underground when there&rsquo;s anything
      going on; they don&rsquo;t seem to reflect that it is unpleasant to a man to be
      treated so! I won&rsquo;t stand it! We have just had a terrible scene!&mdash;mind,
      I speak to you as I would to my own son! Aglaya laughs at her mother. Her
      sisters guessed about Evgenie having proposed and been rejected, and told
      Lizabetha.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you, my dear fellow, Aglaya is such an extraordinary, such a
      self-willed, fantastical little creature, you wouldn&rsquo;t believe it! Every
      high quality, every brilliant trait of heart and mind, are to be found in
      her, and, with it all, so much caprice and mockery, such wild fancies&mdash;indeed,
      a little devil! She has just been laughing at her mother to her very face,
      and at her sisters, and at Prince S., and everybody&mdash;and of course
      she always laughs at me! You know I love the child&mdash;I love her even
      when she laughs at me, and I believe the wild little creature has a
      special fondness for me for that very reason. She is fonder of me than any
      of the others. I dare swear she has had a good laugh at <i>you</i> before
      now! You were having a quiet talk just now, I observed, after all the
      thunder and lightning upstairs. She was sitting with you just as though
      there had been no row at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince blushed painfully in the darkness, and closed his right hand
      tightly, but he said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear good Prince Lef Nicolaievitch,&rdquo; began the general again,
      suddenly, &ldquo;both I and Lizabetha Prokofievna&mdash;(who has begun to
      respect you once more, and me through you, goodness knows why!)&mdash;we
      both love you very sincerely, and esteem you, in spite of any appearances
      to the contrary. But you&rsquo;ll admit what a riddle it must have been for us
      when that calm, cold, little spitfire, Aglaya&mdash;(for she stood up to
      her mother and answered her questions with inexpressible contempt, and
      mine still more so, because, like a fool, I thought it my duty to assert
      myself as head of the family)&mdash;when Aglaya stood up of a sudden and
      informed us that &lsquo;that madwoman&rsquo; (strangely enough, she used exactly the
      same expression as you did) &lsquo;has taken it into her head to marry me to
      Prince Lef Nicolaievitch, and therefore is doing her best to choke Evgenie
      Pavlovitch off, and rid the house of him.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s what she said. She would
      not give the slightest explanation; she burst out laughing, banged the
      door, and went away. We all stood there with our mouths open. Well, I was
      told afterwards of your little passage with Aglaya this afternoon, and&mdash;and&mdash;dear
      prince&mdash;you are a good, sensible fellow, don&rsquo;t be angry if I speak
      out&mdash;she is laughing at you, my boy! She is enjoying herself like a
      child, at your expense, and therefore, since she is a child, don&rsquo;t be
      angry with her, and don&rsquo;t think anything of it. I assure you, she is
      simply making a fool of you, just as she does with one and all of us out
      of pure lack of something better to do. Well&mdash;good-bye! You know our
      feelings, don&rsquo;t you&mdash;our sincere feelings for yourself? They are
      unalterable, you know, dear boy, under all circumstances, but&mdash;Well,
      here we part; I must go down to the right. Rarely have I sat so
      uncomfortably in my saddle, as they say, as I now sit. And people talk of
      the charms of a country holiday!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Left to himself at the cross-roads, the prince glanced around him, quickly
      crossed the road towards the lighted window of a neighbouring house, and
      unfolded a tiny scrap of paper which he had held clasped in his right hand
      during the whole of his conversation with the general.
    </p>
    <p>
      He read the note in the uncertain rays that fell from the window. It was
      as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tomorrow morning, I shall be at the green bench in the park at seven, and
      shall wait there for you. I have made up my mind to speak to you about a
      most important matter which closely concerns yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P.S.&mdash;I trust that you will not show this note to anyone. Though I
      am ashamed of giving you such instructions, I feel that I must do so,
      considering what you are. I therefore write the words, and blush for your
      simple character.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P.P.S.&mdash;It is the same green bench that I showed you before. There!
      aren&rsquo;t you ashamed of yourself? I felt that it was necessary to repeat
      even that information.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The note was written and folded anyhow, evidently in a great hurry, and
      probably just before Aglaya had come down to the verandah.
    </p>
    <p>
      In inexpressible agitation, amounting almost to fear, the prince slipped
      quickly away from the window, away from the light, like a frightened
      thief, but as he did so he collided violently with some gentleman who
      seemed to spring from the earth at his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was watching for you, prince,&rdquo; said the individual.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that you, Keller?&rdquo; said the prince, in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve been looking for you. I waited for you at the Epanchins&rsquo; house,
      but of course I could not come in. I dogged you from behind as you walked
      along with the general. Well, prince, here is Keller, absolutely at your
      service&mdash;command him!&mdash;ready to sacrifice himself&mdash;even to
      die in case of need.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, why?&mdash;Of course you&rsquo;ll be challenged! That was young Lieutenant
      Moloftsoff. I know him, or rather of him; he won&rsquo;t pass an insult. He will
      take no notice of Rogojin and myself, and, therefore, you are the only one
      left to account for. You&rsquo;ll have to pay the piper, prince. He has been
      asking about you, and undoubtedly his friend will call on you tomorrow&mdash;perhaps
      he is at your house already. If you would do me the honour to have me for
      a second, prince, I should be happy. That&rsquo;s why I have been looking for
      you now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Duel! You&rsquo;ve come to talk about a duel, too!&rdquo; The prince burst out
      laughing, to the great astonishment of Keller. He laughed unrestrainedly,
      and Keller, who had been on pins and needles, and in a fever of excitement
      to offer himself as &ldquo;second,&rdquo; was very near being offended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You caught him by the arms, you know, prince. No man of proper pride can
      stand that sort of treatment in public.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and he gave me a fearful dig in the chest,&rdquo; cried the prince, still
      laughing. &ldquo;What are we to fight about? I shall beg his pardon, that&rsquo;s all.
      But if we must fight&mdash;we&rsquo;ll fight! Let him have a shot at me, by all
      means; I should rather like it. Ha, ha, ha! I know how to load a pistol
      now; do you know how to load a pistol, Keller? First, you have to buy the
      powder, you know; it mustn&rsquo;t be wet, and it mustn&rsquo;t be that coarse stuff
      that they load cannons with&mdash;it must be pistol powder. Then you pour
      the powder in, and get hold of a bit of felt from some door, and then
      shove the bullet in. But don&rsquo;t shove the bullet in before the powder,
      because the thing wouldn&rsquo;t go off&mdash;do you hear, Keller, the thing
      wouldn&rsquo;t go off! Ha, ha, ha! Isn&rsquo;t that a grand reason, Keller, my friend,
      eh? Do you know, my dear fellow, I really must kiss you, and embrace you,
      this very moment. Ha, ha! How was it you so suddenly popped up in front of
      me as you did? Come to my house as soon as you can, and we&rsquo;ll have some
      champagne. We&rsquo;ll all get drunk! Do you know I have a dozen of champagne in
      Lebedeff&rsquo;s cellar? Lebedeff sold them to me the day after I arrived. I
      took the lot. We&rsquo;ll invite everybody! Are you going to do any sleeping
      tonight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As much as usual, prince&mdash;why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pleasant dreams then&mdash;ha, ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince crossed the road, and disappeared into the park, leaving the
      astonished Keller in a state of ludicrous wonder. He had never before seen
      the prince in such a strange condition of mind, and could not have
      imagined the possibility of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fever, probably,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;for the man is all nerves, and
      this business has been a little too much for him. He is not <i>afraid</i>,
      that&rsquo;s clear; that sort never funks! H&rsquo;m! champagne! That was an
      interesting item of news, at all events!&mdash;Twelve bottles! Dear me,
      that&rsquo;s a very respectable little stock indeed! I bet anything Lebedeff
      lent somebody money on deposit of this dozen of champagne. Hum! he&rsquo;s a
      nice fellow, is this prince! I like this sort of man. Well, I needn&rsquo;t be
      wasting time here, and if it&rsquo;s a case of champagne, why&mdash;there&rsquo;s no
      time like the present!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That the prince was almost in a fever was no more than the truth. He
      wandered about the park for a long while, and at last came to himself in a
      lonely avenue. He was vaguely conscious that he had already paced this
      particular walk&mdash;from that large, dark tree to the bench at the other
      end&mdash;about a hundred yards altogether&mdash;at least thirty times
      backwards and forwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to recollecting what he had been thinking of all that time, he could
      not. He caught himself, however, indulging in one thought which made him
      roar with laughter, though there was nothing really to laugh at in it; but
      he felt that he must laugh, and go on laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      It struck him that the idea of the duel might not have occurred to Keller
      alone, but that his lesson in the art of pistol-loading might have been
      not altogether accidental! &ldquo;Pooh! nonsense!&rdquo; he said to himself, struck by
      another thought, of a sudden. &ldquo;Why, she was immensely surprised to find me
      there on the verandah, and laughed and talked about <i>tea!</i> And yet
      she had this little note in her hand, therefore she must have known that I
      was sitting there. So why was she surprised? Ha, ha, ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pulled the note out and kissed it; then paused and reflected. &ldquo;How
      strange it all is! how strange!&rdquo; he muttered, melancholy enough now. In
      moments of great joy, he invariably felt a sensation of melancholy come
      over him&mdash;he could not tell why.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked intently around him, and wondered why he had come here; he was
      very tired, so he approached the bench and sat down on it. Around him was
      profound silence; the music in the Vauxhall was over. The park seemed
      quite empty, though it was not, in reality, later than half-past eleven.
      It was a quiet, warm, clear night&mdash;a real Petersburg night of early
      June; but in the dense avenue, where he was sitting, it was almost pitch
      dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      If anyone had come up at this moment and told him that he was in love,
      passionately in love, he would have rejected the idea with astonishment,
      and, perhaps, with irritation. And if anyone had added that Aglaya&rsquo;s note
      was a love-letter, and that it contained an appointment to a lover&rsquo;s
      rendezvous, he would have blushed with shame for the speaker, and,
      probably, have challenged him to a duel.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this would have been perfectly sincere on his part. He had never for a
      moment entertained the idea of the possibility of this girl loving him, or
      even of such a thing as himself falling in love with her. The possibility
      of being loved himself, &ldquo;a man like me,&rdquo; as he put it, he ranked among
      ridiculous suppositions. It appeared to him that it was simply a joke on
      Aglaya&rsquo;s part, if there really were anything in it at all; but that seemed
      to him quite natural. His preoccupation was caused by something different.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the few words which the general had let slip about Aglaya laughing
      at everybody, and at himself most of all&mdash;he entirely believed them.
      He did not feel the slightest sensation of offence; on the contrary, he
      was quite certain that it was as it should be.
    </p>
    <p>
      His whole thoughts were now as to next morning early; he would see her; he
      would sit by her on that little green bench, and listen to how pistols
      were loaded, and look at her. He wanted nothing more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The question as to what she might have to say of special interest to
      himself occurred to him once or twice. He did not doubt, for a moment,
      that she really had some such subject of conversation in store, but so
      very little interested in the matter was he that it did not strike him to
      wonder what it could be. The crunch of gravel on the path suddenly caused
      him to raise his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man, whose face it was difficult to see in the gloom, approached the
      bench, and sat down beside him. The prince peered into his face, and
      recognized the livid features of Rogojin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew you&rsquo;d be wandering about somewhere here. I didn&rsquo;t have to look for
      you very long,&rdquo; muttered the latter between his teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the first time they had met since the encounter on the staircase at
      the hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Painfully surprised as he was at this sudden apparition of Rogojin, the
      prince, for some little while, was unable to collect his thoughts.
      Rogojin, evidently, saw and understood the impression he had made; and
      though he seemed more or less confused at first, yet he began talking with
      what looked like assumed ease and freedom. However, the prince soon
      changed his mind on this score, and thought that there was not only no
      affectation of indifference, but that Rogojin was not even particularly
      agitated. If there were a little apparent awkwardness, it was only in his
      words and gestures. The man could not change his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you&mdash;find me here?&rdquo; asked the prince for the sake of saying
      something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keller told me (I found him at your place) that you were in the park. &lsquo;Of
      course he is!&rsquo; I thought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; asked the prince uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rogojin smiled, but did not explain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I received your letter, Lef Nicolaievitch&mdash;what&rsquo;s the good of all
      that?&mdash;It&rsquo;s no use, you know. I&rsquo;ve come to you from <i>her</i>,&mdash;she
      bade me tell you that she must see you, she has something to say to you.
      She told me to find you today.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come tomorrow. Now I&rsquo;m going home&mdash;are you coming to my house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I? I&rsquo;ve given you the message.&mdash;Goodbye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come?&rdquo; asked the prince in a gentle voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an extraordinary man you are! I wonder at you!&rdquo; Rogojin laughed
      sarcastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you hate me so?&rdquo; asked the prince, sadly. &ldquo;You know yourself that
      all you suspected is quite unfounded. I felt you were still angry with me,
      though. Do you know why? Because you tried to kill me&mdash;that&rsquo;s why you
      can&rsquo;t shake off your wrath against me. I tell you that I only remember the
      Parfen Rogojin with whom I exchanged crosses, and vowed brotherhood. I
      wrote you this in yesterday&rsquo;s letter, in order that you might forget all
      that madness on your part, and that you might not feel called to talk
      about it when we met. Why do you avoid me? Why do you hold your hand back
      from me? I tell you again, I consider all that has passed a delirium, an
      insane dream. I can understand all you did, and all you felt that day, as
      if it were myself. What you were then imagining was not the case, and
      could never be the case. Why, then, should there be anger between us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what anger is!&rdquo; laughed Rogojin, in reply to the prince&rsquo;s
      heated words.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had moved a pace or two away, and was hiding his hands behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it is impossible for me to come to your house again,&rdquo; he added
      slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? Do you hate me so much as all that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t love you, Lef Nicolaievitch, and, therefore, what would be the
      use of my coming to see you? You are just like a child&mdash;you want a
      plaything, and it must be taken out and given you&mdash;and then you don&rsquo;t
      know how to work it. You are simply repeating all you said in your letter,
      and what&rsquo;s the use? Of course I believe every word you say, and I know
      perfectly well that you neither did or ever can deceive me in any way, and
      yet, I don&rsquo;t love you. You write that you&rsquo;ve forgotten everything, and
      only remember your brother Parfen, with whom you exchanged crosses, and
      that you don&rsquo;t remember anything about the Rogojin who aimed a knife at
      your throat. What do you know about my feelings, eh?&rdquo; (Rogojin laughed
      disagreeably.) &ldquo;Here you are holding out your brotherly forgiveness to me
      for a thing that I have perhaps never repented of in the slightest degree.
      I did not think of it again all that evening; all my thoughts were centred
      on something else&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not think of it again? Of course you didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; cried the prince. &ldquo;And I
      dare swear that you came straight away down here to Pavlofsk to listen to
      the music and dog her about in the crowd, and stare at her, just as you
      did today. There&rsquo;s nothing surprising in that! If you hadn&rsquo;t been in that
      condition of mind that you could think of nothing but one subject, you
      would, probably, never have raised your knife against me. I had a
      presentiment of what you would do, that day, ever since I saw you first in
      the morning. Do you know yourself what you looked like? I knew you would
      try to murder me even at the very moment when we exchanged crosses. What
      did you take me to your mother for? Did you think to stay your hand by
      doing so? Perhaps you did not put your thoughts into words, but you and I
      were thinking the same thing, or feeling the same thing looming over us,
      at the same moment. What should you think of me now if you had not raised
      your knife to me&mdash;the knife which God averted from my throat? I would
      have been guilty of suspecting you all the same&mdash;and you would have
      intended the murder all the same; therefore we should have been mutually
      guilty in any case. Come, don&rsquo;t frown; you needn&rsquo;t laugh at me, either.
      You say you haven&rsquo;t &lsquo;repented.&rsquo; Repented! You probably couldn&rsquo;t, if you
      were to try; you dislike me too much for that. Why, if I were an angel of
      light, and as innocent before you as a babe, you would still loathe me if
      you believed that <i>she</i> loved me, instead of loving yourself. That&rsquo;s
      jealousy&mdash;that is the real jealousy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But do you know what I have been thinking out during this last week,
      Parfen? I&rsquo;ll tell you. What if she loves you now better than anyone? And
      what if she torments you <i>because</i> she loves you, and in proportion
      to her love for you, so she torments you the more? She won&rsquo;t tell you
      this, of course; you must have eyes to see. Why do you suppose she
      consents to marry you? She must have a reason, and that reason she will
      tell you some day. Some women desire the kind of love you give her, and
      she is probably one of these. Your love and your wild nature impress her.
      Do you know that a woman is capable of driving a man crazy almost, with
      her cruelties and mockeries, and feels not one single pang of regret,
      because she looks at him and says to herself, &lsquo;There! I&rsquo;ll torment this
      man nearly into his grave, and then, oh! how I&rsquo;ll compensate him for it
      all with my love!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rogojin listened to the end, and then burst out laughing:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, prince, I declare you must have had a taste of this sort of thing
      yourself&mdash;haven&rsquo;t you? I have heard tell of something of the kind,
      you know; is it true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? What can you have heard?&rdquo; said the prince, stammering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rogojin continued to laugh loudly. He had listened to the prince&rsquo;s speech
      with curiosity and some satisfaction. The speaker&rsquo;s impulsive warmth had
      surprised and even comforted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;ve not only heard of it; I see it for myself,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;When have
      you ever spoken like that before? It wasn&rsquo;t like yourself, prince. Why, if
      I hadn&rsquo;t heard this report about you, I should never have come all this
      way into the park&mdash;at midnight, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you in the least, Parfen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, <i>she</i> told me all about it long ago, and tonight I saw for
      myself. I saw you at the music, you know, and whom you were sitting with.
      She swore to me yesterday, and again today, that you are madly in love
      with Aglaya Ivanovna. But that&rsquo;s all the same to me, prince, and it&rsquo;s not
      my affair at all; for if you have ceased to love <i>her</i>, <i>she</i>
      has not ceased to love <i>you</i>. You know, of course, that she wants to
      marry you to that girl? She&rsquo;s sworn to it! Ha, ha! She says to me, &lsquo;Until
      then I won&rsquo;t marry you. When they go to church, we&rsquo;ll go too&mdash;and not
      before.&rsquo; What on earth does she mean by it? I don&rsquo;t know, and I never did.
      Either she loves you without limits or&mdash;yet, if she loves you, why
      does she wish to marry you to another girl? She says, &lsquo;I want to see him
      happy,&rsquo; which is to say&mdash;she loves you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wrote, and I say to you once more, that she is not in her right mind,&rdquo;
       said the prince, who had listened with anguish to what Rogojin said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodness knows&mdash;you may be wrong there! At all events, she named the
      day this evening, as we left the gardens. &lsquo;In three weeks,&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;and
      perhaps sooner, we shall be married.&rsquo; She swore to it, took off her cross
      and kissed it. So it all depends upon you now, prince, You see! Ha, ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all madness. What you say about me, Parfen, never can and never
      will be. Tomorrow, I shall come and see you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can she be mad,&rdquo; Rogojin interrupted, &ldquo;when she is sane enough for
      other people and only mad for you? How can she write letters to <i>her</i>,
      if she&rsquo;s mad? If she were insane they would observe it in her letters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What letters?&rdquo; said the prince, alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She writes to <i>her</i>&mdash;and the girl reads the letters. Haven&rsquo;t
      you heard?&mdash;You are sure to hear; she&rsquo;s sure to show you the letters
      herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t believe this!&rdquo; cried the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, prince, you&rsquo;ve only gone a few steps along this road, I perceive.
      You are evidently a mere beginner. Wait a bit! Before long, you&rsquo;ll have
      your own detectives, you&rsquo;ll watch day and night, and you&rsquo;ll know every
      little thing that goes on there&mdash;that is, if&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drop that subject, Rogojin, and never mention it again. And listen: as I
      have sat here, and talked, and listened, it has suddenly struck me that
      tomorrow is my birthday. It must be about twelve o&rsquo;clock, now; come home
      with me&mdash;do, and we&rsquo;ll see the day in! We&rsquo;ll have some wine, and you
      shall wish me&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what&mdash;but you, especially you, must
      wish me a good wish, and I shall wish you full happiness in return.
      Otherwise, hand me my cross back again. You didn&rsquo;t return it to me next
      day. Haven&rsquo;t you got it on now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have,&rdquo; said Rogojin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along, then. I don&rsquo;t wish to meet my new year without you&mdash;my
      new life, I should say, for a new life is beginning for me. Did you know,
      Parfen, that a new life had begun for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see for myself that it is so&mdash;and I shall tell <i>her</i>. But you
      are not quite yourself, Lef Nicolaievitch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <h3>
      IV.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The prince observed with great surprise, as he approached his villa,
      accompanied by Rogojin, that a large number of people were assembled on
      his verandah, which was brilliantly lighted up. The company seemed merry
      and were noisily laughing and talking&mdash;even quarrelling, to judge
      from the sounds. At all events they were clearly enjoying themselves, and
      the prince observed further on closer investigation&mdash;that all had
      been drinking champagne. To judge from the lively condition of some of the
      party, it was to be supposed that a considerable quantity of champagne had
      been consumed already.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the guests were known to the prince; but the curious part of the
      matter was that they had all arrived on the same evening, as though with
      one accord, although he had only himself recollected the fact that it was
      his birthday a few moments since.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have told somebody you were going to trot out the champagne, and
      that&rsquo;s why they are all come!&rdquo; muttered Rogojin, as the two entered the
      verandah. &ldquo;We know all about that! You&rsquo;ve only to whistle and they come up
      in shoals!&rdquo; he continued, almost angrily. He was doubtless thinking of his
      own late experiences with his boon companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      All surrounded the prince with exclamations of welcome, and, on hearing
      that it was his birthday, with cries of congratulation and delight; many
      of them were very noisy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The presence of certain of those in the room surprised the prince vastly,
      but the guest whose advent filled him with the greatest wonder&mdash;almost
      amounting to alarm&mdash;was Evgenie Pavlovitch. The prince could not
      believe his eyes when he beheld the latter, and could not help thinking
      that something was wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lebedeff ran up promptly to explain the arrival of all these gentlemen. He
      was himself somewhat intoxicated, but the prince gathered from his
      long-winded periods that the party had assembled quite naturally, and
      accidentally.
    </p>
    <p>
      First of all Hippolyte had arrived, early in the evening, and feeling
      decidedly better, had determined to await the prince on the verandah.
      There Lebedeff had joined him, and his household had followed&mdash;that
      is, his daughters and General Ivolgin. Burdovsky had brought Hippolyte,
      and stayed on with him. Gania and Ptitsin had dropped in accidentally
      later on; then came Keller, and he and Colia insisted on having champagne.
      Evgenie Pavlovitch had only dropped in half an hour or so ago. Lebedeff
      had served the champagne readily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My own though, prince, my own, mind,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and there&rsquo;ll be some
      supper later on; my daughter is getting it ready now. Come and sit down,
      prince, we are all waiting for you, we want you with us. Fancy what we
      have been discussing! You know the question, &lsquo;to be or not to be,&rsquo;&mdash;out
      of Hamlet! A contemporary theme! Quite up-to-date! Mr. Hippolyte has been
      eloquent to a degree. He won&rsquo;t go to bed, but he has only drunk a little
      champagne, and that can&rsquo;t do him any harm. Come along, prince, and settle
      the question. Everyone is waiting for you, sighing for the light of your
      luminous intelligence...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince noticed the sweet, welcoming look on Vera Lebedeff&rsquo;s face, as
      she made her way towards him through the crowd. He held out his hand to
      her. She took it, blushing with delight, and wished him &ldquo;a happy life from
      that day forward.&rdquo; Then she ran off to the kitchen, where her presence was
      necessary to help in the preparations for supper. Before the prince&rsquo;s
      arrival she had spent some time on the terrace, listening eagerly to the
      conversation, though the visitors, mostly under the influence of wine,
      were discussing abstract subjects far beyond her comprehension. In the
      next room her younger sister lay on a wooden chest, sound asleep, with her
      mouth wide open; but the boy, Lebedeff&rsquo;s son, had taken up his position
      close beside Colia and Hippolyte, his face lit up with interest in the
      conversation of his father and the rest, to which he would willingly have
      listened for ten hours at a stretch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have waited for you on purpose, and am very glad to see you arrive so
      happy,&rdquo; said Hippolyte, when the prince came forward to press his hand,
      immediately after greeting Vera.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how do you know that I am &lsquo;so happy&rsquo;?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can see it by your face! Say &lsquo;how do you do&rsquo; to the others, and come
      and sit down here, quick&mdash;I&rsquo;ve been waiting for you!&rdquo; he added,
      accentuating the fact that he had waited. On the prince&rsquo;s asking, &ldquo;Will it
      not be injurious to you to sit out so late?&rdquo; he replied that he could not
      believe that he had thought himself dying three days or so ago, for he
      never had felt better than this evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burdovsky next jumped up and explained that he had come in by accident,
      having escorted Hippolyte from town. He murmured that he was glad he had
      &ldquo;written nonsense&rdquo; in his letter, and then pressed the prince&rsquo;s hand
      warmly and sat down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince approached Evgenie Pavlovitch last of all. The latter
      immediately took his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a couple of words to say to you,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;and those on a very
      important matter; let&rsquo;s go aside for a minute or two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a couple of words!&rdquo; whispered another voice in the prince&rsquo;s other
      ear, and another hand took his other arm. Muishkin turned, and to his
      great surprise observed a red, flushed face and a droll-looking figure
      which he recognized at once as that of Ferdishenko. Goodness knows where
      he had turned up from!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember Ferdishenko?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where have you dropped from?&rdquo; cried the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is sorry for his sins now, prince,&rdquo; cried Keller. &ldquo;He did not want to
      let you know he was here; he was hidden over there in the corner,&mdash;but
      he repents now, he feels his guilt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what has he done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I met him outside and brought him in&mdash;he&rsquo;s a gentleman who doesn&rsquo;t
      often allow his friends to see him, of late&mdash;but he&rsquo;s sorry now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Delighted, I&rsquo;m sure!&mdash;I&rsquo;ll come back directly, gentlemen,&mdash;sit
      down there with the others, please,&mdash;excuse me one moment,&rdquo; said the
      host, getting away with difficulty in order to follow Evgenie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very gay here,&rdquo; began the latter, &ldquo;and I have had quite a
      pleasant half-hour while I waited for you. Now then, my dear Lef
      Nicolaievitch, this is what&rsquo;s the matter. I&rsquo;ve arranged it all with
      Moloftsoff, and have just come in to relieve your mind on that score. You
      need be under no apprehensions. He was very sensible, as he should be, of
      course, for I think he was entirely to blame himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What Moloftsoff?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The young fellow whose arms you held, don&rsquo;t you know? He was so wild with
      you that he was going to send a friend to you tomorrow morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What nonsense!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it is nonsense, and in nonsense it would have ended, doubtless;
      but you know these fellows, they&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, but I think you must have something else that you wished to
      speak about, Evgenie Pavlovitch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, I have!&rdquo; said the other, laughing. &ldquo;You see, my dear fellow,
      tomorrow, very early in the morning, I must be off to town about this
      unfortunate business (my uncle, you know!). Just imagine, my dear sir, it
      is all true&mdash;word for word&mdash;and, of course, everybody knew it
      excepting myself. All this has been such a blow to me that I have not
      managed to call in at the Epanchins&rsquo;. Tomorrow I shall not see them
      either, because I shall be in town. I may not be here for three days or
      more; in a word, my affairs are a little out of gear. But though my town
      business is, of course, most pressing, still I determined not to go away
      until I had seen you, and had a clear understanding with you upon certain
      points; and that without loss of time. I will wait now, if you will allow
      me, until the company departs; I may just as well, for I have nowhere else
      to go to, and I shall certainly not do any sleeping tonight; I&rsquo;m far too
      excited. And finally, I must confess that, though I know it is bad form to
      pursue a man in this way, I have come to beg your friendship, my dear
      prince. You are an unusual sort of a person; you don&rsquo;t lie at every step,
      as some men do; in fact, you don&rsquo;t lie at all, and there is a matter in
      which I need a true and sincere friend, for I really may claim to be among
      the number of bona fide unfortunates just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the trouble is,&rdquo; said the prince, after a slight pause for
      reflection, &ldquo;that goodness only knows when this party will break up.
      Hadn&rsquo;t we better stroll into the park? I&rsquo;ll excuse myself, there&rsquo;s no
      danger of their going away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! I have my reasons for wishing them not to suspect us of being
      engaged in any specially important conversation. There are gentry present
      who are a little too much interested in us. You are not aware of that
      perhaps, prince? It will be a great deal better if they see that we are
      friendly just in an ordinary way. They&rsquo;ll all go in a couple of hours, and
      then I&rsquo;ll ask you to give me twenty minutes&mdash;half an hour at most.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By all means! I assure you I am delighted&mdash;you need not have entered
      into all these explanations. As for your remarks about friendship with me&mdash;thanks,
      very much indeed. You must excuse my being a little absent this evening.
      Do you know, I cannot somehow be attentive to anything just now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see, I see,&rdquo; said Evgenie, smiling gently. His mirth seemed very near
      the surface this evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you see?&rdquo; said the prince, startled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to suspect that I have simply come here to deceive you
      and pump information out of you!&rdquo; said Evgenie, still smiling, and without
      making any direct reply to the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but I haven&rsquo;t the slightest doubt that you did come to pump me,&rdquo; said
      the prince, laughing himself, at last; &ldquo;and I dare say you are quite
      prepared to deceive me too, so far as that goes. But what of that? I&rsquo;m not
      afraid of you; besides, you&rsquo;ll hardly believe it, I feel as though I
      really didn&rsquo;t care a scrap one way or the other, just now!&mdash;And&mdash;and&mdash;and
      as you are a capital fellow, I am convinced of that, I dare say we really
      shall end by being good friends. I like you very much Evgenie Pavlovitch;
      I consider you a very good fellow indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, in any case, you are a most delightful man to have to deal with, be
      the business what it may,&rdquo; concluded Evgenie. &ldquo;Come along now, I&rsquo;ll drink
      a glass to your health. I&rsquo;m charmed to have entered into alliance with
      you. By-the-by,&rdquo; he added suddenly, &ldquo;has this young Hippolyte come down to
      stay with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not going to die at once, I should think, is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;ve been half an hour here with him, and he&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hippolyte had been waiting for the prince all this time, and had never
      ceased looking at him and Evgenie Pavlovitch as they conversed in the
      corner. He became much excited when they approached the table once more.
      He was disturbed in his mind, it seemed; perspiration stood in large drops
      on his forehead; in his gleaming eyes it was easy to read impatience and
      agitation; his gaze wandered from face to face of those present, and from
      object to object in the room, apparently without aim. He had taken a part,
      and an animated one, in the noisy conversation of the company; but his
      animation was clearly the outcome of fever. His talk was almost
      incoherent; he would break off in the middle of a sentence which he had
      begun with great interest, and forget what he had been saying. The prince
      discovered to his dismay that Hippolyte had been allowed to drink two
      large glasses of champagne; the one now standing by him being the third.
      All this he found out afterwards; at the moment he did not notice
      anything, very particularly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know I am specially glad that today is your birthday!&rdquo; cried
      Hippolyte.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll soon see. D&rsquo;you know I had a feeling that there would be a lot of
      people here tonight? It&rsquo;s not the first time that my presentiments have
      been fulfilled. I wish I had known it was your birthday, I&rsquo;d have brought
      you a present&mdash;perhaps I have got a present for you! Who knows? Ha,
      ha! How long is it now before daylight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a couple of hours,&rdquo; said Ptitsin, looking at his watch. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the
      good of daylight now? One can read all night in the open air without it,&rdquo;
       said someone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The good of it! Well, I want just to see a ray of the sun,&rdquo; said
      Hippolyte. &ldquo;Can one drink to the sun&rsquo;s health, do you think, prince?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I dare say one can; but you had better be calm and lie down,
      Hippolyte&mdash;that&rsquo;s much more important.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are always preaching about resting; you are a regular nurse to me,
      prince. As soon as the sun begins to &lsquo;resound&rsquo; in the sky&mdash;what poet
      said that? &lsquo;The sun resounded in the sky.&rsquo; It is beautiful, though there&rsquo;s
      no sense in it!&mdash;then we will go to bed. Lebedeff, tell me, is the
      sun the source of life? What does the source, or &lsquo;spring,&rsquo; of life really
      mean in the Apocalypse? You have heard of the &lsquo;Star that is called
      Wormwood,&rsquo; prince?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard that Lebedeff explains it as the railroads that cover Europe
      like a net.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Everybody laughed, and Lebedeff got up abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! Allow me, that is not what we are discussing!&rdquo; he cried, waving his
      hand to impose silence. &ldquo;Allow me! With these gentlemen... all these
      gentlemen,&rdquo; he added, suddenly addressing the prince, &ldquo;on certain
      points... that is...&rdquo; He thumped the table repeatedly, and the laughter
      increased. Lebedeff was in his usual evening condition, and had just ended
      a long and scientific argument, which had left him excited and irritable.
      On such occasions he was apt to evince a supreme contempt for his
      opponents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not right! Half an hour ago, prince, it was agreed among us that no
      one should interrupt, no one should laugh, that each person was to express
      his thoughts freely; and then at the end, when everyone had spoken,
      objections might be made, even by the atheists. We chose the general as
      president. Now without some such rule and order, anyone might be shouted
      down, even in the loftiest and most profound thought....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on! Go on! Nobody is going to interrupt you!&rdquo; cried several voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak, but keep to the point!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is this &lsquo;star&rsquo;?&rdquo; asked another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no idea,&rdquo; replied General Ivolgin, who presided with much gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love these arguments, prince,&rdquo; said Keller, also more than half
      intoxicated, moving restlessly in his chair. &ldquo;Scientific and political.&rdquo;
       Then, turning suddenly towards Evgenie Pavlovitch, who was seated near
      him: &ldquo;Do you know, I simply adore reading the accounts of the debates in
      the English parliament. Not that the discussions themselves interest me; I
      am not a politician, you know; but it delights me to see how they address
      each other &lsquo;the noble lord who agrees with me,&rsquo; &lsquo;my honourable opponent
      who astonished Europe with his proposal,&rsquo; &lsquo;the noble viscount sitting
      opposite&rsquo;&mdash;all these expressions, all this parliamentarism of a free
      people, has an enormous attraction for me. It fascinates me, prince. I
      have always been an artist in the depths of my soul, I assure you, Evgenie
      Pavlovitch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say,&rdquo; cried Gania, from the other corner, &ldquo;do you mean to
      say that railways are accursed inventions, that they are a source of ruin
      to humanity, a poison poured upon the earth to corrupt the springs of
      life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gavrila Ardalionovitch was in high spirits that evening, and it seemed to
      the prince that his gaiety was mingled with triumph. Of course he was only
      joking with Lebedeff, meaning to egg him on, but he grew excited himself
      at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the railways, oh dear, no!&rdquo; replied Lebedeff, with a mixture of
      violent anger and extreme enjoyment. &ldquo;Considered alone, the railways will
      not pollute the springs of life, but as a whole they are accursed. The
      whole tendency of our latest centuries, in its scientific and
      materialistic aspect, is most probably accursed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it certainly accursed?... or do you only mean it might be? That is an
      important point,&rdquo; said Evgenie Pavlovitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is accursed, certainly accursed!&rdquo; replied the clerk, vehemently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go so fast, Lebedeff; you are much milder in the morning,&rdquo; said
      Ptitsin, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, on the other hand, more frank in the evening! In the evening sincere
      and frank,&rdquo; repeated Lebedeff, earnestly. &ldquo;More candid, more exact, more
      honest, more honourable, and... although I may show you my weak side, I
      challenge you all; you atheists, for instance! How are you going to save
      the world? How find a straight road of progress, you men of science, of
      industry, of cooperation, of trades unions, and all the rest? How are you
      going to save it, I say? By what? By credit? What is credit? To what will
      credit lead you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are too inquisitive,&rdquo; remarked Evgenie Pavlovitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, anyone who does not interest himself in questions such as this is,
      in my opinion, a mere fashionable dummy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it will lead at least to solidarity, and balance of interests,&rdquo; said
      Ptitsin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will reach that with nothing to help you but credit? Without recourse
      to any moral principle, having for your foundation only individual
      selfishness, and the satisfaction of material desires? Universal peace,
      and the happiness of mankind as a whole, being the result! Is it really so
      that I may understand you, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the universal necessity of living, of drinking, of eating&mdash;in
      short, the whole scientific conviction that this necessity can only be
      satisfied by universal co-operation and the solidarity of interests&mdash;is,
      it seems to me, a strong enough idea to serve as a basis, so to speak, and
      a &lsquo;spring of life,&rsquo; for humanity in future centuries,&rdquo; said Gavrila
      Ardalionovitch, now thoroughly roused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The necessity of eating and drinking, that is to say, solely the instinct
      of self-preservation...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is not that enough? The instinct of self-preservation is the normal law
      of humanity...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who told you that?&rdquo; broke in Evgenie Pavlovitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a law, doubtless, but a law neither more nor less normal than that
      of destruction, even self-destruction. Is it possible that the whole
      normal law of humanity is contained in this sentiment of
      self-preservation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried Hippolyte, turning towards Evgenie Pavlovitch, and looking at
      him with a queer sort of curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then seeing that Radomski was laughing, he began to laugh himself, nudged
      Colia, who was sitting beside him, with his elbow, and again asked what
      time it was. He even pulled Colia&rsquo;s silver watch out of his hand, and
      looked at it eagerly. Then, as if he had forgotten everything, he
      stretched himself out on the sofa, put his hands behind his head, and
      looked up at the sky. After a minute or two he got up and came back to the
      table to listen to Lebedeff&rsquo;s outpourings, as the latter passionately
      commentated on Evgenie Pavlovitch&rsquo;s paradox.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is an artful and traitorous idea. A smart notion,&rdquo; vociferated the
      clerk, &ldquo;thrown out as an apple of discord. But it is just. You are a
      scoffer, a man of the world, a cavalry officer, and, though not without
      brains, you do not realize how profound is your thought, nor how true.
      Yes, the laws of self-preservation and of self-destruction are equally
      powerful in this world. The devil will hold his empire over humanity until
      a limit of time which is still unknown. You laugh? You do not believe in
      the devil? Scepticism as to the devil is a French idea, and it is also a
      frivolous idea. Do you know who the devil is? Do you know his name?
      Although you don&rsquo;t know his name you make a mockery of his form, following
      the example of Voltaire. You sneer at his hoofs, at his tail, at his horns&mdash;all
      of them the produce of your imagination! In reality the devil is a great
      and terrible spirit, with neither hoofs, nor tail, nor horns; it is you
      who have endowed him with these attributes! But... he is not the question
      just now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know he is not the question now?&rdquo; cried Hippolyte, laughing
      hysterically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another excellent idea, and worth considering!&rdquo; replied Lebedeff. &ldquo;But,
      again, that is not the question. The question at this moment is whether we
      have not weakened &lsquo;the springs of life&rsquo; by the extension...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of railways?&rdquo; put in Colia eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not railways, properly speaking, presumptuous youth, but the general
      tendency of which railways may be considered as the outward expression and
      symbol. We hurry and push and hustle, for the good of humanity! &lsquo;The world
      is becoming too noisy, too commercial!&rsquo; groans some solitary thinker.
      &lsquo;Undoubtedly it is, but the noise of waggons bearing bread to starving
      humanity is of more value than tranquillity of soul,&rsquo; replies another
      triumphantly, and passes on with an air of pride. As for me, I don&rsquo;t
      believe in these waggons bringing bread to humanity. For, founded on no
      moral principle, these may well, even in the act of carrying bread to
      humanity, coldly exclude a considerable portion of humanity from enjoying
      it; that has been seen more than once.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, these waggons may coldly exclude?&rdquo; repeated someone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That has been seen already,&rdquo; continued Lebedeff, not deigning to notice
      the interruption. &ldquo;Malthus was a friend of humanity, but, with ill-founded
      moral principles, the friend of humanity is the devourer of humanity,
      without mentioning his pride; for, touch the vanity of one of these
      numberless philanthropists, and to avenge his self-esteem, he will be
      ready at once to set fire to the whole globe; and to tell the truth, we
      are all more or less like that. I, perhaps, might be the first to set a
      light to the fuel, and then run away. But, again, I must repeat, that is
      not the question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it then, for goodness&rsquo; sake?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is boring us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The question is connected with the following anecdote of past times; for
      I am obliged to relate a story. In our times, and in our country, which I
      hope you love as much as I do, for as far as I am concerned, I am ready to
      shed the last drop of my blood...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on! Go on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In our dear country, as indeed in the whole of Europe, a famine visits
      humanity about four times a century, as far as I can remember; once in
      every twenty-five years. I won&rsquo;t swear to this being the exact figure, but
      anyhow they have become comparatively rare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Comparatively to what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the twelfth century, and those immediately preceding and following it.
      We are told by historians that widespread famines occurred in those days
      every two or three years, and such was the condition of things that men
      actually had recourse to cannibalism, in secret, of course. One of these
      cannibals, who had reached a good age, declared of his own free will that
      during the course of his long and miserable life he had personally killed
      and eaten, in the most profound secrecy, sixty monks, not to mention
      several children; the number of the latter he thought was about six, an
      insignificant total when compared with the enormous mass of ecclesiastics
      consumed by him. As to adults, laymen that is to say, he had never touched
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The president joined in the general outcry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s impossible!&rdquo; said he in an aggrieved tone. &ldquo;I am often discussing
      subjects of this nature with him, gentlemen, but for the most part he
      talks nonsense enough to make one deaf: this story has no pretence of
      being true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;General, remember the siege of Kars! And you, gentlemen, I assure you my
      anecdote is the naked truth. I may remark that reality, although it is
      governed by invariable law, has at times a resemblance to falsehood. In
      fact, the truer a thing is the less true it sounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But could anyone possibly eat sixty monks?&rdquo; objected the scoffing
      listeners.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is quite clear that he did not eat them all at once, but in a space of
      fifteen or twenty years: from that point of view the thing is
      comprehensible and natural...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Natural?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And natural,&rdquo; repeated Lebedeff with pedantic obstinacy. &ldquo;Besides, a
      Catholic monk is by nature excessively curious; it would be quite easy
      therefore to entice him into a wood, or some secret place, on false
      pretences, and there to deal with him as said. But I do not dispute in the
      least that the number of persons consumed appears to denote a spice of
      greediness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is perhaps true, gentlemen,&rdquo; said the prince, quietly. He had been
      listening in silence up to that moment without taking part in the
      conversation, but laughing heartily with the others from time to time.
      Evidently he was delighted to see that everybody was amused, that
      everybody was talking at once, and even that everybody was drinking. It
      seemed as if he were not intending to speak at all, when suddenly he
      intervened in such a serious voice that everyone looked at him with
      interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true that there were frequent famines at that time, gentlemen. I
      have often heard of them, though I do not know much history. But it seems
      to me that it must have been so. When I was in Switzerland I used to look
      with astonishment at the many ruins of feudal castles perched on the top
      of steep and rocky heights, half a mile at least above sea-level, so that
      to reach them one had to climb many miles of stony tracks. A castle, as
      you know, is, a kind of mountain of stones&mdash;a dreadful, almost an
      impossible, labour! Doubtless the builders were all poor men, vassals, and
      had to pay heavy taxes, and to keep up the priesthood. How, then, could
      they provide for themselves, and when had they time to plough and sow
      their fields? The greater number must, literally, have died of starvation.
      I have sometimes asked myself how it was that these communities were not
      utterly swept off the face of the earth, and how they could possibly
      survive. Lebedeff is not mistaken, in my opinion, when he says that there
      were cannibals in those days, perhaps in considerable numbers; but I do
      not understand why he should have dragged in the monks, nor what he means
      by that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is undoubtedly because, in the twelfth century, monks were the only
      people one could eat; they were the fat, among many lean,&rdquo; said Gavrila
      Ardalionovitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A brilliant idea, and most true!&rdquo; cried Lebedeff, &ldquo;for he never even
      touched the laity. Sixty monks, and not a single layman! It is a terrible
      idea, but it is historic, it is statistic; it is indeed one of those facts
      which enables an intelligent historian to reconstruct the physiognomy of a
      special epoch, for it brings out this further point with mathematical
      accuracy, that the clergy were in those days sixty times richer and more
      flourishing than the rest of humanity and perhaps sixty times fatter
      also...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are exaggerating, you are exaggerating, Lebedeff!&rdquo; cried his hearers,
      amid laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I admit that it is an historic thought, but what is your conclusion?&rdquo;
       asked the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke so seriously in addressing Lebedeff, that his tone contrasted
      quite comically with that of the others. They were very nearly laughing at
      him, too, but he did not notice it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see he is a lunatic, prince?&rdquo; whispered Evgenie Pavlovitch in
      his ear. &ldquo;Someone told me just now that he is a bit touched on the subject
      of lawyers, that he has a mania for making speeches and intends to pass
      the examinations. I am expecting a splendid burlesque now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My conclusion is vast,&rdquo; replied Lebedeff, in a voice like thunder. &ldquo;Let
      us examine first the psychological and legal position of the criminal. We
      see that in spite of the difficulty of finding other food, the accused,
      or, as we may say, my client, has often during his peculiar life exhibited
      signs of repentance, and of wishing to give up this clerical diet.
      Incontrovertible facts prove this assertion. He has eaten five or six
      children, a relatively insignificant number, no doubt, but remarkable
      enough from another point of view. It is manifest that, pricked by remorse&mdash;for
      my client is religious, in his way, and has a conscience, as I shall prove
      later&mdash;and desiring to extenuate his sin as far as possible, he has
      tried six times at least to substitute lay nourishment for clerical. That
      this was merely an experiment we can hardly doubt: for if it had been only
      a question of gastronomic variety, six would have been too few; why only
      six? Why not thirty? But if we regard it as an experiment, inspired by the
      fear of committing new sacrilege, then this number six becomes
      intelligible. Six attempts to calm his remorse, and the pricking of his
      conscience, would amply suffice, for these attempts could scarcely have
      been happy ones. In my humble opinion, a child is too small; I should say,
      not sufficient; which would result in four or five times more lay children
      than monks being required in a given time. The sin, lessened on the one
      hand, would therefore be increased on the other, in quantity, not in
      quality. Please understand, gentlemen, that in reasoning thus, I am taking
      the point of view which might have been taken by a criminal of the middle
      ages. As for myself, a man of the late nineteenth century, I, of course,
      should reason differently; I say so plainly, and therefore you need not
      jeer at me nor mock me, gentlemen. As for you, general, it is still more
      unbecoming on your part. In the second place, and giving my own personal
      opinion, a child&rsquo;s flesh is not a satisfying diet; it is too insipid, too
      sweet; and the criminal, in making these experiments, could have satisfied
      neither his conscience nor his appetite. I am about to conclude,
      gentlemen; and my conclusion contains a reply to one of the most important
      questions of that day and of our own! This criminal ended at last by
      denouncing himself to the clergy, and giving himself up to justice. We
      cannot but ask, remembering the penal system of that day, and the tortures
      that awaited him&mdash;the wheel, the stake, the fire!&mdash;we cannot but
      ask, I repeat, what induced him to accuse himself of this crime? Why did
      he not simply stop short at the number sixty, and keep his secret until
      his last breath? Why could he not simply leave the monks alone, and go
      into the desert to repent? Or why not become a monk himself? That is where
      the puzzle comes in! There must have been something stronger than the
      stake or the fire, or even than the habits of twenty years! There must
      have been an idea more powerful than all the calamities and sorrows of
      this world, famine or torture, leprosy or plague&mdash;an idea which
      entered into the heart, directed and enlarged the springs of life, and
      made even that hell supportable to humanity! Show me a force, a power like
      that, in this our century of vices and railways! I might say, perhaps, in
      our century of steamboats and railways, but I repeat in our century of
      vices and railways, because I am drunk but truthful! Show me a single idea
      which unites men nowadays with half the strength that it had in those
      centuries, and dare to maintain that the &lsquo;springs of life&rsquo; have not been
      polluted and weakened beneath this &lsquo;star,&rsquo; beneath this network in which
      men are entangled! Don&rsquo;t talk to me about your prosperity, your riches,
      the rarity of famine, the rapidity of the means of transport! There is
      more of riches, but less of force. The idea uniting heart and soul to
      heart and soul exists no more. All is loose, soft, limp&mdash;we are all
      of us limp.... Enough, gentlemen! I have done. That is not the question.
      No, the question is now, excellency, I believe, to sit down to the banquet
      you are about to provide for us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lebedeff had roused great indignation in some of his auditors (it should
      be remarked that the bottles were constantly uncorked during his speech);
      but this unexpected conclusion calmed even the most turbulent spirits.
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s how a clever barrister makes a good point!&rdquo; said he, when speaking
      of his peroration later on. The visitors began to laugh and chatter once
      again; the committee left their seats, and stretched their legs on the
      terrace. Keller alone was still disgusted with Lebedeff and his speech; he
      turned from one to another, saying in a loud voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He attacks education, he boasts of the fanaticism of the twelfth century,
      he makes absurd grimaces, and added to that he is by no means the innocent
      he makes himself out to be. How did he get the money to buy this house,
      allow me to ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In another corner was the general, holding forth to a group of hearers,
      among them Ptitsin, whom he had buttonholed. &ldquo;I have known,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;a
      real interpreter of the Apocalypse, the late Gregory Semeonovitch
      Burmistroff, and he&mdash;he pierced the heart like a fiery flash! He
      began by putting on his spectacles, then he opened a large black book; his
      white beard, and his two medals on his breast, recalling acts of charity,
      all added to his impressiveness. He began in a stern voice, and before him
      generals, hard men of the world, bowed down, and ladies fell to the ground
      fainting. But this one here&mdash;he ends by announcing a banquet! That is
      not the real thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ptitsin listened and smiled, then turned as if to get his hat; but if he
      had intended to leave, he changed his mind. Before the others had risen
      from the table, Gania had suddenly left off drinking, and pushed away his
      glass, a dark shadow seemed to come over his face. When they all rose, he
      went and sat down by Rogojin. It might have been believed that quite
      friendly relations existed between them. Rogojin, who had also seemed on
      the point of going away now sat motionless, his head bent, seeming to have
      forgotten his intention. He had drunk no wine, and appeared absorbed in
      reflection. From time to time he raised his eyes, and examined everyone
      present; one might have imagined that he was expecting something very
      important to himself, and that he had decided to wait for it. The prince
      had taken two or three glasses of champagne, and seemed cheerful. As he
      rose he noticed Evgenie Pavlovitch, and, remembering the appointment he
      had made with him, smiled pleasantly. Evgenie Pavlovitch made a sign with
      his head towards Hippolyte, whom he was attentively watching. The invalid
      was fast asleep, stretched out on the sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, prince, why on earth did this boy intrude himself upon you?&rdquo; he
      asked, with such annoyance and irritation in his voice that the prince was
      quite surprised. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t mind laying odds that he is up to some
      mischief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have observed,&rdquo; said the prince, &ldquo;that he seems to be an object of very
      singular interest to you, Evgenie Pavlovitch. Why is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may add that I have surely enough to think of, on my own account,
      without him; and therefore it is all the more surprising that I cannot
      tear my eyes and thoughts away from his detestable physiognomy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come! He has a handsome face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, look at him&mdash;look at him now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince glanced again at Evgenie Pavlovitch with considerable surprise.
    </p>
    <h3>
      V.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Hippolyte, who had fallen asleep during Lebedeff&rsquo;s discourse, now suddenly
      woke up, just as though someone had jogged him in the side. He shuddered,
      raised himself on his arm, gazed around, and grew very pale. A look almost
      of terror crossed his face as he recollected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! are they all off? Is it all over? Is the sun up?&rdquo; He trembled, and
      caught at the prince&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;What time is it? Tell me, quick, for
      goodness&rsquo; sake! How long have I slept?&rdquo; he added, almost in despair, just
      as though he had overslept something upon which his whole fate depended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have slept seven or perhaps eight minutes,&rdquo; said Evgenie Pavlovitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hippolyte gazed eagerly at the latter, and mused for a few moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, is that all?&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;Then I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew a long, deep breath of relief, as it seemed. He realized that all
      was not over as yet, that the sun had not risen, and that the guests had
      merely gone to supper. He smiled, and two hectic spots appeared on his
      cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you counted the minutes while I slept, did you, Evgenie Pavlovitch?&rdquo;
       he said, ironically. &ldquo;You have not taken your eyes off me all the evening&mdash;I
      have noticed that much, you see! Ah, Rogojin! I&rsquo;ve just been dreaming
      about him, prince,&rdquo; he added, frowning. &ldquo;Yes, by the by,&rdquo; starting up,
      &ldquo;where&rsquo;s the orator? Where&rsquo;s Lebedeff? Has he finished? What did he talk
      about? Is it true, prince, that you once declared that &lsquo;beauty would save
      the world&rsquo;? Great Heaven! The prince says that beauty saves the world! And
      I declare that he only has such playful ideas because he&rsquo;s in love!
      Gentlemen, the prince is in love. I guessed it the moment he came in.
      Don&rsquo;t blush, prince; you make me sorry for you. What beauty saves the
      world? Colia told me that you are a zealous Christian; is it so? Colia
      says you call yourself a Christian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince regarded him attentively, but said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t answer me; perhaps you think I am very fond of you?&rdquo; added
      Hippolyte, as though the words had been drawn from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think that. I know you don&rsquo;t love me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, after yesterday? Wasn&rsquo;t I honest with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew yesterday that you didn&rsquo;t love me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so? why so? Because I envy you, eh? You always think that, I know.
      But do you know why I am saying all this? Look here! I must have some more
      champagne&mdash;pour me out some, Keller, will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re not to drink any more, Hippolyte. I won&rsquo;t let you.&rdquo; The prince
      moved the glass away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well perhaps you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; said Hippolyte, musing. &ldquo;They might say&mdash;yet,
      devil take them! what does it matter?&mdash;prince, what can it matter
      what people will say of us <i>then</i>, eh? I believe I&rsquo;m half asleep.
      I&rsquo;ve had such a dreadful dream&mdash;I&rsquo;ve only just remembered it. Prince,
      I don&rsquo;t wish you such dreams as that, though sure enough, perhaps, I <i>don&rsquo;t</i>
      love you. Why wish a man evil, though you do not love him, eh? Give me
      your hand&mdash;let me press it sincerely. There&mdash;you&rsquo;ve given me
      your hand&mdash;you must feel that I <i>do</i> press it sincerely, don&rsquo;t
      you? I don&rsquo;t think I shall drink any more. What time is it? Never mind, I
      know the time. The time has come, at all events. What! they are laying
      supper over there, are they? Then this table is free? Capital, gentlemen!
      I&mdash;hem! these gentlemen are not listening. Prince, I will just read
      over an article I have here. Supper is more interesting, of course, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Hippolyte suddenly, and most unexpectedly, pulled out of his
      breast-pocket a large sealed paper. This imposing-looking document he
      placed upon the table before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect of this sudden action upon the company was instantaneous.
      Evgenie Pavlovitch almost bounded off his chair in excitement. Rogojin
      drew nearer to the table with a look on his face as if he knew what was
      coming. Gania came nearer too; so did Lebedeff and the others&mdash;the
      paper seemed to be an object of great interest to the company in general.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you got there?&rdquo; asked the prince, with some anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the first glimpse of the rising sun, prince, I will go to bed. I told
      you I would, word of honour! You shall see!&rdquo; cried Hippolyte. &ldquo;You think
      I&rsquo;m not capable of opening this packet, do you?&rdquo; He glared defiantly round
      at the audience in general.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince observed that he was trembling all over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None of us ever thought such a thing!&rdquo; Muishkin replied for all. &ldquo;Why
      should you suppose it of us? And what are you going to read, Hippolyte?
      What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, what is it?&rdquo; asked others. The packet sealed with red wax seemed to
      attract everyone, as though it were a magnet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wrote this yesterday, myself, just after I saw you, prince, and told
      you I would come down here. I wrote all day and all night, and finished it
      this morning early. Afterwards I had a dream.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t we better hear it tomorrow?&rdquo; asked the prince timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tomorrow &lsquo;there will be no more time!&rsquo;&rdquo; laughed Hippolyte, hysterically.
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t be afraid; I shall get through the whole thing in forty
      minutes, at most an hour! Look how interested everybody is! Everybody has
      drawn near. Look! look at them all staring at my sealed packet! If I
      hadn&rsquo;t sealed it up it wouldn&rsquo;t have been half so effective! Ha, ha!
      that&rsquo;s mystery, that is! Now then, gentlemen, shall I break the seal or
      not? Say the word; it&rsquo;s a mystery, I tell you&mdash;a secret! Prince, you
      know who said there would be &lsquo;no more time&rsquo;? It was the great and powerful
      angel in the Apocalypse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better not read it now,&rdquo; said the prince, putting his hand on the packet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t read it!&rdquo; cried Evgenie suddenly. He appeared so strangely
      disturbed that many of those present could not help wondering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reading? None of your reading now!&rdquo; said somebody; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s supper-time.&rdquo;
       &ldquo;What sort of an article is it? For a paper? Probably it&rsquo;s very dull,&rdquo;
       said another. But the prince&rsquo;s timid gesture had impressed even Hippolyte.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m not to read it?&rdquo; he whispered, nervously. &ldquo;Am I not to read it?&rdquo;
       he repeated, gazing around at each face in turn. &ldquo;What are you afraid of,
      prince?&rdquo; he turned and asked the latter suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What should I be afraid of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has anyone a coin about them? Give me a twenty-copeck piece, somebody!&rdquo;
       And Hippolyte leapt from his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here you are,&rdquo; said Lebedeff, handing him one; he thought the boy had
      gone mad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vera Lukianovna,&rdquo; said Hippolyte, &ldquo;toss it, will you? Heads, I read,
      tails, I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vera Lebedeff tossed the coin into the air and let it fall on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was &ldquo;heads.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I read it,&rdquo; said Hippolyte, in the tone of one bowing to the fiat of
      destiny. He could not have grown paler if a verdict of death had suddenly
      been presented to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But after all, what is it? Is it possible that I should have just risked
      my fate by tossing up?&rdquo; he went on, shuddering; and looked round him
      again. His eyes had a curious expression of sincerity. &ldquo;That is an
      astonishing psychological fact,&rdquo; he cried, suddenly addressing the prince,
      in a tone of the most intense surprise. &ldquo;It is... it is something quite
      inconceivable, prince,&rdquo; he repeated with growing animation, like a man
      regaining consciousness. &ldquo;Take note of it, prince, remember it; you
      collect, I am told, facts concerning capital punishment... They told me
      so. Ha, ha! My God, how absurd!&rdquo; He sat down on the sofa, put his elbows
      on the table, and laid his head on his hands. &ldquo;It is shameful&mdash;though
      what does it matter to me if it is shameful?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, gentlemen! I am about to break the seal,&rdquo; he continued, with
      determination. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;of course I don&rsquo;t insist upon anyone
      listening if they do not wish to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With trembling fingers he broke the seal and drew out several sheets of
      paper, smoothed them out before him, and began sorting them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth does all this mean? What&rsquo;s he going to read?&rdquo; muttered
      several voices. Others said nothing; but one and all sat down and watched
      with curiosity. They began to think something strange might really be
      about to happen. Vera stood and trembled behind her father&rsquo;s chair, almost
      in tears with fright; Colia was nearly as much alarmed as she was.
      Lebedeff jumped up and put a couple of candles nearer to Hippolyte, so
      that he might see better.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, this&mdash;you&rsquo;ll soon see what this is,&rdquo; began Hippolyte, and
      suddenly commenced his reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s headed, &lsquo;A Necessary Explanation,&rsquo; with the motto, &lsquo;<i>Après moi le
      déluge!</i>&rsquo; Oh, deuce take it all! Surely I can never have seriously
      written such a silly motto as that? Look here, gentlemen, I beg to give
      notice that all this is very likely terrible nonsense. It is only a few
      ideas of mine. If you think that there is anything mysterious coming&mdash;or
      in a word&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better read on without any more beating about the bush,&rdquo; said Gania.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Affectation!&rdquo; remarked someone else.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too much talk,&rdquo; said Rogojin, breaking the silence for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hippolyte glanced at him suddenly, and when their eyes met Rogojin showed
      his teeth in a disagreeable smile, and said the following strange words:
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the way to settle this business, my friend; that&rsquo;s not the way
      at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of course nobody knew what Rogojin meant by this; but his words made a
      deep impression upon all. Everyone seemed to see in a flash the same idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Hippolyte, their effect upon him was astounding. He trembled so
      that the prince was obliged to support him, and would certainly have cried
      out, but that his voice seemed to have entirely left him for the moment.
      For a minute or two he could not speak at all, but panted and stared at
      Rogojin. At last he managed to ejaculate:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it was <i>you</i> who came&mdash;<i>you</i>&mdash;<i>you?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Came where? What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Rogojin, amazed. But Hippolyte,
      panting and choking with excitement, interrupted him violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>You</i> came to me last week, in the night, at two o&rsquo;clock, the day I
      was with you in the morning! Confess it was you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last week? In the night? Have you gone cracked, my good friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hippolyte paused and considered a moment. Then a smile of cunning&mdash;almost
      triumph&mdash;crossed his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was you,&rdquo; he murmured, almost in a whisper, but with absolute
      conviction. &ldquo;Yes, it was you who came to my room and sat silently on a
      chair at my window for a whole hour&mdash;more! It was between one and two
      at night; you rose and went out at about three. It was you, you! Why you
      should have frightened me so, why you should have wished to torment me
      like that, I cannot tell&mdash;but you it was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was absolute hatred in his eyes as he said this, but his look of
      fear and his trembling had not left him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall hear all this directly, gentlemen. I&mdash;I&mdash;listen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seized his paper in a desperate hurry; he fidgeted with it, and tried
      to sort it, but for a long while his trembling hands could not collect the
      sheets together. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s either mad or delirious,&rdquo; murmured Rogojin. At last
      he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first five minutes the reader&rsquo;s voice continued to tremble, and he
      read disconnectedly and unevenly; but gradually his voice strengthened.
      Occasionally a violent fit of coughing stopped him, but his animation grew
      with the progress of the reading&mdash;as did also the disagreeable
      impression which it made upon his audience,&mdash;until it reached the
      highest pitch of excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is the article.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
      MY NECESSARY EXPLANATION.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Après moi le déluge.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yesterday morning the prince came to see me. Among other things he asked
      me to come down to his villa. I knew he would come and persuade me to this
      step, and that he would adduce the argument that it would be easier for me
      to die &lsquo;among people and green trees,&rsquo;&mdash;as he expressed it. But today
      he did not say &lsquo;die,&rsquo; he said &lsquo;live.&rsquo; It is pretty much the same to me, in
      my position, which he says. When I asked him why he made such a point of
      his &lsquo;green trees,&rsquo; he told me, to my astonishment, that he had heard that
      last time I was in Pavlofsk I had said that I had come &lsquo;to have a last
      look at the trees.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I observed that it was all the same whether one died among trees or
      in front of a blank brick wall, as here, and that it was not worth making
      any fuss over a fortnight, he agreed at once. But he insisted that the
      good air at Pavlofsk and the greenness would certainly cause a physical
      change for the better, and that my excitement, and my <i>dreams</i>, would
      be perhaps relieved. I remarked to him, with a smile, that he spoke like a
      materialist, and he answered that he had always been one. As he never
      tells a lie, there must be something in his words. His smile is a pleasant
      one. I have had a good look at him. I don&rsquo;t know whether I like him or
      not; and I have no time to waste over the question. The hatred which I
      felt for him for five months has become considerably modified, I may say,
      during the last month. Who knows, perhaps I am going to Pavlofsk on
      purpose to see him! But why do I leave my chamber? Those who are sentenced
      to death should not leave their cells. If I had not formed a final
      resolve, but had decided to wait until the last minute, I should not leave
      my room, or accept his invitation to come and die at Pavlofsk. I must be
      quick and finish this explanation before tomorrow. I shall have no time to
      read it over and correct it, for I must read it tomorrow to the prince and
      two or three witnesses whom I shall probably find there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As it will be absolutely true, without a touch of falsehood, I am curious
      to see what impression it will make upon me myself at the moment when I
      read it out. This is my &lsquo;last and solemn&rsquo;&mdash;but why need I call it
      that? There is no question about the truth of it, for it is not worthwhile
      lying for a fortnight; a fortnight of life is not itself worth having,
      which is a proof that I write nothing here but pure truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      (&ldquo;N.B.&mdash;Let me remember to consider; am I mad at this moment, or not?
      or rather at these moments? I have been told that consumptives sometimes
      do go out of their minds for a while in the last stages of the malady. I
      can prove this tomorrow when I read it out, by the impression it makes
      upon the audience. I must settle this question once and for all, otherwise
      I can&rsquo;t go on with anything.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe I have just written dreadful nonsense; but there&rsquo;s no time for
      correcting, as I said before. Besides that, I have made myself a promise
      not to alter a single word of what I write in this paper, even though I
      find that I am contradicting myself every five lines. I wish to verify the
      working of the natural logic of my ideas tomorrow during the reading&mdash;whether
      I am capable of detecting logical errors, and whether all that I have
      meditated over during the last six months be true, or nothing but
      delirium.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If two months since I had been called upon to leave my room and the view
      of Meyer&rsquo;s wall opposite, I verily believe I should have been sorry. But
      now I have no such feeling, and yet I am leaving this room and Meyer&rsquo;s
      brick wall <i>for ever</i>. So that my conclusion, that it is not worth
      while indulging in grief, or any other emotion, for a fortnight, has
      proved stronger than my very nature, and has taken over the direction of
      my feelings. But is it so? Is it the case that my nature is conquered
      entirely? If I were to be put on the rack now, I should certainly cry out.
      I should not say that it is not worth while to yell and feel pain because
      I have but a fortnight to live.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But is it true that I have but a fortnight of life left to me? I know I
      told some of my friends that Doctor B. had informed me that this was the
      case; but I now confess that I lied; B. has not even seen me. However, a
      week ago, I called in a medical student, Kislorodoff, who is a
      Nationalist, an Atheist, and a Nihilist, by conviction, and that is why I
      had him. I needed a man who would tell me the bare truth without any
      humbug or ceremony&mdash;and so he did&mdash;indeed, almost with pleasure
      (which I thought was going a little too far).
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he plumped out that I had about a month left me; it might be a
      little more, he said, under favourable circumstances, but it might also be
      considerably less. According to his opinion I might die quite suddenly&mdash;tomorrow,
      for instance&mdash;there had been such cases. Only a day or two since a
      young lady at Colomna who suffered from consumption, and was about on a
      par with myself in the march of the disease, was going out to market to
      buy provisions, when she suddenly felt faint, lay down on the sofa, gasped
      once, and died.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kislorodoff told me all this with a sort of exaggerated devil-may-care
      negligence, and as though he did me great honour by talking to me so,
      because it showed that he considered me the same sort of exalted
      Nihilistic being as himself, to whom death was a matter of no consequence
      whatever, either way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At all events, the fact remained&mdash;a month of life and no more! That
      he is right in his estimation I am absolutely persuaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It puzzles me much to think how on earth the prince guessed yesterday
      that I have had bad dreams. He said to me, &lsquo;Your excitement and dreams
      will find relief at Pavlofsk.&rsquo; Why did he say &lsquo;dreams&rsquo;? Either he is a
      doctor, or else he is a man of exceptional intelligence and wonderful
      powers of observation. (But that he is an &lsquo;idiot,&rsquo; at bottom there can be
      no doubt whatever.) It so happened that just before he arrived I had a
      delightful little dream; one of a kind that I have hundreds of just now. I
      had fallen asleep about an hour before he came in, and dreamed that I was
      in some room, not my own. It was a large room, well furnished, with a
      cupboard, chest of drawers, sofa, and my bed, a fine wide bed covered with
      a silken counterpane. But I observed in the room a dreadful-looking
      creature, a sort of monster. It was a little like a scorpion, but was not
      a scorpion, but far more horrible, and especially so, because there are no
      creatures anything like it in nature, and because it had appeared to me
      for a purpose, and bore some mysterious signification. I looked at the
      beast well; it was brown in colour and had a shell; it was a crawling kind
      of reptile, about eight inches long, and narrowed down from the head,
      which was about a couple of fingers in width, to the end of the tail,
      which came to a fine point. Out of its trunk, about a couple of inches
      below its head, came two legs at an angle of forty-five degrees, each
      about three inches long, so that the beast looked like a trident from
      above. It had eight hard needle-like whiskers coming out from different
      parts of its body; it went along like a snake, bending its body about in
      spite of the shell it wore, and its motion was very quick and very
      horrible to look at. I was dreadfully afraid it would sting me; somebody
      had told me, I thought, that it was venomous; but what tormented me most
      of all was the wondering and wondering as to who had sent it into my room,
      and what was the mystery which I felt it contained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It hid itself under the cupboard and under the chest of drawers, and
      crawled into the corners. I sat on a chair and kept my legs tucked under
      me. Then the beast crawled quietly across the room and disappeared
      somewhere near my chair. I looked about for it in terror, but I still
      hoped that as my feet were safely tucked away it would not be able to
      touch me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suddenly I heard behind me, and about on a level with my head, a sort of
      rattling sound. I turned sharp round and saw that the brute had crawled up
      the wall as high as the level of my face, and that its horrible tail,
      which was moving incredibly fast from side to side, was actually touching
      my hair! I jumped up&mdash;and it disappeared. I did not dare lie down on
      my bed for fear it should creep under my pillow. My mother came into the
      room, and some friends of hers. They began to hunt for the reptile and
      were more composed than I was; they did not seem to be afraid of it. But
      they did not understand as I did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suddenly the monster reappeared; it crawled slowly across the room and
      made for the door, as though with some fixed intention, and with a slow
      movement that was more horrible than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then my mother opened the door and called my dog, Norma. Norma was a
      great Newfoundland, and died five years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She sprang forward and stood still in front of the reptile as if she had
      been turned to stone. The beast stopped too, but its tail and claws still
      moved about. I believe animals are incapable of feeling supernatural
      fright&mdash;if I have been rightly informed,&mdash;but at this moment
      there appeared to me to be something more than ordinary about Norma&rsquo;s
      terror, as though it must be supernatural; and as though she felt, just as
      I did myself, that this reptile was connected with some mysterious secret,
      some fatal omen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Norma backed slowly and carefully away from the brute, which followed
      her, creeping deliberately after her as though it intended to make a
      sudden dart and sting her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In spite of Norma&rsquo;s terror she looked furious, though she trembled in all
      her limbs. At length she slowly bared her terrible teeth, opened her great
      red jaws, hesitated&mdash;took courage, and seized the beast in her mouth.
      It seemed to try to dart out of her jaws twice, but Norma caught at it and
      half swallowed it as it was escaping. The shell cracked in her teeth; and
      the tail and legs stuck out of her mouth and shook about in a horrible
      manner. Suddenly Norma gave a piteous whine; the reptile had bitten her
      tongue. She opened her mouth wide with the pain, and I saw the beast lying
      across her tongue, and out of its body, which was almost bitten in two,
      came a hideous white-looking substance, oozing out into Norma&rsquo;s mouth; it
      was of the consistency of a crushed black-beetle. Just then I awoke and the
      prince entered the room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen!&rdquo; said Hippolyte, breaking off here, &ldquo;I have not done yet, but
      it seems to me that I have written down a great deal here that is
      unnecessary,&mdash;this dream&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have indeed!&rdquo; said Gania.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is too much about myself, I know, but&mdash;&rdquo; As Hippolyte said
      this his face wore a tired, pained look, and he wiped the sweat off his
      brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Lebedeff, &ldquo;you certainly think a great deal too much about
      yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;gentlemen&mdash;I do not force anyone to listen! If any of you
      are unwilling to sit it out, please go away, by all means!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He turns people out of a house that isn&rsquo;t his own,&rdquo; muttered Rogojin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose we all go away?&rdquo; said Ferdishenko suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hippolyte clutched his manuscript, and gazing at the last speaker with
      glittering eyes, said: &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t like me at all!&rdquo; A few laughed at this,
      but not all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hippolyte,&rdquo; said the prince, &ldquo;give me the papers, and go to bed like a
      sensible fellow. We&rsquo;ll have a good talk tomorrow, but you really mustn&rsquo;t
      go on with this reading; it is not good for you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I? How can I?&rdquo; cried Hippolyte, looking at him in amazement.
      &ldquo;Gentlemen! I was a fool! I won&rsquo;t break off again. Listen, everyone who
      wants to!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gulped down some water out of a glass standing near, bent over the
      table, in order to hide his face from the audience, and recommenced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The idea that it is not worth while living for a few weeks took
      possession of me a month ago, when I was told that I had four weeks to
      live, but only partially so at that time. The idea quite overmastered me
      three days since, that evening at Pavlofsk. The first time that I felt
      really impressed with this thought was on the terrace at the prince&rsquo;s, at
      the very moment when I had taken it into my head to make a last trial of
      life. I wanted to see people and trees (I believe I said so myself), I got
      excited, I maintained Burdovsky&rsquo;s rights, &lsquo;my neighbour!&rsquo;&mdash;I dreamt
      that one and all would open their arms, and embrace me, that there would
      be an indescribable exchange of forgiveness between us all! In a word, I
      behaved like a fool, and then, at that very same instant, I felt my &lsquo;last
      conviction.&rsquo; I ask myself now how I could have waited six months for that
      conviction! I knew that I had a disease that spares no one, and I really
      had no illusions; but the more I realized my condition, the more I clung
      to life; I wanted to live at any price. I confess I might well have
      resented that blind, deaf fate, which, with no apparent reason, seemed to
      have decided to crush me like a fly; but why did I not stop at resentment?
      Why did I begin to live, knowing that it was not worthwhile to begin? Why
      did I attempt to do what I knew to be an impossibility? And yet I could
      not even read a book to the end; I had given up reading. What is the good
      of reading, what is the good of learning anything, for just six months?
      That thought has made me throw aside a book more than once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that wall of Meyer&rsquo;s could tell a tale if it liked. There was no
      spot on its dirty surface that I did not know by heart. Accursed wall! and
      yet it is dearer to me than all the Pavlofsk trees!&mdash;That is&mdash;it
      <i>would</i> be dearer if it were not all the same to me, now!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember now with what hungry interest I began to watch the lives of
      other people&mdash;interest that I had never felt before! I used to wait
      for Colia&rsquo;s arrival impatiently, for I was so ill myself, then, that I
      could not leave the house. I so threw myself into every little detail of
      news, and took so much interest in every report and rumour, that I believe
      I became a regular gossip! I could not understand, among other things, how
      all these people&mdash;with so much life in and before them&mdash;do not
      become <i>rich</i>&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t understand it now. I remember being
      told of a poor wretch I once knew, who had died of hunger. I was almost
      beside myself with rage! I believe if I could have resuscitated him I
      would have done so for the sole purpose of murdering him!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Occasionally I was so much better that I could go out; but the streets
      used to put me in such a rage that I would lock myself up for days rather
      than go out, even if I were well enough to do so! I could not bear to see
      all those preoccupied, anxious-looking creatures continuously surging
      along the streets past me! Why are they always anxious? What is the
      meaning of their eternal care and worry? It is their wickedness, their
      perpetual detestable malice&mdash;that&rsquo;s what it is&mdash;they are all
      full of malice, malice!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whose fault is it that they are all miserable, that they don&rsquo;t know how
      to live, though they have fifty or sixty years of life before them? Why
      did that fool allow himself to die of hunger with sixty years of unlived
      life before him?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And everyone of them shows his rags, his toil-worn hands, and yells in
      his wrath: &lsquo;Here are we, working like cattle all our lives, and always as
      hungry as dogs, and there are others who do not work, and are fat and
      rich!&rsquo; The eternal refrain! And side by side with them trots along some
      wretched fellow who has known better days, doing light porter&rsquo;s work from
      morn to night for a living, always blubbering and saying that &lsquo;his wife
      died because he had no money to buy medicine with,&rsquo; and his children dying
      of cold and hunger, and his eldest daughter gone to the bad, and so on.
      Oh! I have no pity and no patience for these fools of people. Why can&rsquo;t
      they be Rothschilds? Whose fault is it that a man has not got millions of
      money like Rothschild? If he has life, all this must be in his power!
      Whose fault is it that he does not know how to live his life?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! it&rsquo;s all the same to me now&mdash;<i>now!</i> But at that time I
      would soak my pillow at night with tears of mortification, and tear at my
      blanket in my rage and fury. Oh, how I longed at that time to be turned
      out&mdash;<i>me</i>, eighteen years old, poor, half-clothed, turned out
      into the street, quite alone, without lodging, without work, without a
      crust of bread, without relations, without a single acquaintance, in some
      large town&mdash;hungry, beaten (if you like), but in good health&mdash;and
      <i>then</i> I would show them&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would I show them?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t think that I have no sense of my own humiliation! I have
      suffered already in reading so far. Which of you all does not think me a
      fool at this moment&mdash;a young fool who knows nothing of life&mdash;forgetting
      that to live as I have lived these last six months is to live longer than
      grey-haired old men. Well, let them laugh, and say it is all nonsense, if
      they please. They may say it is all fairy-tales, if they like; and I have
      spent whole nights telling myself fairy-tales. I remember them all. But
      how can I tell fairy-tales now? The time for them is over. They amused me
      when I found that there was not even time for me to learn the Greek
      grammar, as I wanted to do. &lsquo;I shall die before I get to the syntax,&rsquo; I
      thought at the first page&mdash;and threw the book under the table. It is
      there still, for I forbade anyone to pick it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If this &lsquo;Explanation&rsquo; gets into anybody&rsquo;s hands, and they have patience
      to read it through, they may consider me a madman, or a schoolboy, or,
      more likely, a man condemned to die, who thought it only natural to
      conclude that all men, excepting himself, esteem life far too lightly,
      live it far too carelessly and lazily, and are, therefore, one and all,
      unworthy of it. Well, I affirm that my reader is wrong again, for my
      convictions have nothing to do with my sentence of death. Ask them, ask
      any one of them, or all of them, what they mean by happiness! Oh, you may
      be perfectly sure that if Columbus was happy, it was not after he had
      discovered America, but when he was discovering it! You may be quite sure
      that he reached the culminating point of his happiness three days before
      he saw the New World with his actual eyes, when his mutinous sailors
      wanted to tack about, and return to Europe! What did the New World matter
      after all? Columbus had hardly seen it when he died, and in reality he was
      entirely ignorant of what he had discovered. The important thing is life&mdash;life
      and nothing else! What is any &lsquo;discovery&rsquo; whatever compared with the
      incessant, eternal discovery of life?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is the use of talking? I&rsquo;m afraid all this is so commonplace
      that my confession will be taken for a schoolboy exercise&mdash;the work
      of some ambitious lad writing in the hope of his work &lsquo;seeing the light&rsquo;;
      or perhaps my readers will say that &lsquo;I had perhaps something to say, but
      did not know how to express it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me add to this that in every idea emanating from genius, or even in
      every serious human idea&mdash;born in the human brain&mdash;there always
      remains something&mdash;some sediment&mdash;which cannot be expressed to
      others, though one wrote volumes and lectured upon it for five-and-thirty
      years. There is always a something, a remnant, which will never come out
      from your brain, but will remain there with you, and you alone, for ever
      and ever, and you will die, perhaps, without having imparted what may be
      the very essence of your idea to a single living soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that if I cannot now impart all that has tormented me for the last six
      months, at all events you will understand that, having reached my &lsquo;last
      convictions,&rsquo; I must have paid a very dear price for them. That is what I
      wished, for reasons of my own, to make a point of in this my
      &lsquo;Explanation.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But let me resume.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <h3>
      VI.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not deceive you. &lsquo;Reality&rsquo; got me so entrapped in its meshes now
      and again during the past six months, that I forgot my &lsquo;sentence&rsquo; (or
      perhaps I did not wish to think of it), and actually busied myself with
      affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A word as to my circumstances. When, eight months since, I became very
      ill, I threw up all my old connections and dropped all my old companions.
      As I was always a gloomy, morose sort of individual, my friends easily
      forgot me; of course, they would have forgotten me all the same, without
      that excuse. My position at home was solitary enough. Five months ago I
      separated myself entirely from the family, and no one dared enter my room
      except at stated times, to clean and tidy it, and so on, and to bring me
      my meals. My mother dared not disobey me; she kept the children quiet, for
      my sake, and beat them if they dared to make any noise and disturb me. I
      so often complained of them that I should think they must be very fond,
      indeed, of me by this time. I think I must have tormented &lsquo;my faithful
      Colia&rsquo; (as I called him) a good deal too. He tormented me of late; I could
      see that he always bore my tempers as though he had determined to &lsquo;spare
      the poor invalid.&rsquo; This annoyed me, naturally. He seemed to have taken it
      into his head to imitate the prince in Christian meekness! Surikoff, who
      lived above us, annoyed me, too. He was so miserably poor, and I used to
      prove to him that he had no one to blame but himself for his poverty. I
      used to be so angry that I think I frightened him eventually, for he
      stopped coming to see me. He was a most meek and humble fellow, was
      Surikoff. (N.B.&mdash;They say that meekness is a great power. I must ask
      the prince about this, for the expression is his.) But I remember one day
      in March, when I went up to his lodgings to see whether it was true that
      one of his children had been starved and frozen to death, I began to hold
      forth to him about his poverty being his own fault, and, in the course of
      my remarks, I accidentally smiled at the corpse of his child. Well, the
      poor wretch&rsquo;s lips began to tremble, and he caught me by the shoulder, and
      pushed me to the door. &lsquo;Go out,&rsquo; he said, in a whisper. I went out, of
      course, and I declare I <i>liked</i> it. I liked it at the very moment
      when I was turned out. But his words filled me with a strange sort of
      feeling of disdainful pity for him whenever I thought of them&mdash;a
      feeling which I did not in the least desire to entertain. At the very
      moment of the insult (for I admit that I did insult him, though I did not
      mean to), this man could not lose his temper. His lips had trembled, but I
      swear it was not with rage. He had taken me by the arm, and said, &lsquo;Go
      out,&rsquo; without the least anger. There was dignity, a great deal of dignity,
      about him, and it was so inconsistent with the look of him that, I assure
      you, it was quite comical. But there was no anger. Perhaps he merely began
      to despise me at that moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since that time he has always taken off his hat to me on the stairs,
      whenever I met him, which is a thing he never did before; but he always
      gets away from me as quickly as he can, as though he felt confused. If he
      did despise me, he despised me &lsquo;meekly,&rsquo; after his own fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say he only took his hat off out of fear, as it were, to the son
      of his creditor; for he always owed my mother money. I thought of having
      an explanation with him, but I knew that if I did, he would begin to
      apologize in a minute or two, so I decided to let him alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just about that time, that is, the middle of March, I suddenly felt very
      much better; this continued for a couple of weeks. I used to go out at
      dusk. I like the dusk, especially in March, when the night frost begins to
      harden the day&rsquo;s puddles, and the gas is burning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, one night in the Shestilavochnaya, a man passed me with a paper
      parcel under his arm. I did not take stock of him very carefully, but he
      seemed to be dressed in some shabby summer dust-coat, much too light for
      the season. When he was opposite the lamp-post, some ten yards away, I
      observed something fall out of his pocket. I hurried forward to pick it
      up, just in time, for an old wretch in a long kaftan rushed up too. He did
      not dispute the matter, but glanced at what was in my hand and
      disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a large old-fashioned pocket-book, stuffed full; but I guessed, at
      a glance, that it had anything in the world inside it, except money.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The owner was now some forty yards ahead of me, and was very soon lost in
      the crowd. I ran after him, and began calling out; but as I knew nothing
      to say excepting &lsquo;hey!&rsquo; he did not turn round. Suddenly he turned into the
      gate of a house to the left; and when I darted in after him, the gateway
      was so dark that I could see nothing whatever. It was one of those large
      houses built in small tenements, of which there must have been at least a
      hundred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I entered the yard I thought I saw a man going along on the far side
      of it; but it was so dark I could not make out his figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I crossed to that corner and found a dirty dark staircase. I heard a man
      mounting up above me, some way higher than I was, and thinking I should
      catch him before his door would be opened to him, I rushed after him. I
      heard a door open and shut on the fifth storey, as I panted along; the
      stairs were narrow, and the steps innumerable, but at last I reached the
      door I thought the right one. Some moments passed before I found the bell
      and got it to ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An old peasant woman opened the door; she was busy lighting the &lsquo;samovar&rsquo;
      in a tiny kitchen. She listened silently to my questions, did not
      understand a word, of course, and opened another door leading into a
      little bit of a room, low and scarcely furnished at all, but with a large,
      wide bed in it, hung with curtains. On this bed lay one Terentich, as the
      woman called him, drunk, it appeared to me. On the table was an end of
      candle in an iron candlestick, and a half-bottle of vodka, nearly
      finished. Terentich muttered something to me, and signed towards the next
      room. The old woman had disappeared, so there was nothing for me to do but
      to open the door indicated. I did so, and entered the next room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This was still smaller than the other, so cramped that I could scarcely
      turn round; a narrow single bed at one side took up nearly all the room.
      Besides the bed there were only three common chairs, and a wretched old
      kitchen-table standing before a small sofa. One could hardly squeeze
      through between the table and the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the table, as in the other room, burned a tallow candle-end in an iron
      candlestick; and on the bed there whined a baby of scarcely three weeks
      old. A pale-looking woman was dressing the child, probably the mother; she
      looked as though she had not as yet got over the trouble of childbirth,
      she seemed so weak and was so carelessly dressed. Another child, a little
      girl of about three years old, lay on the sofa, covered over with what
      looked like a man&rsquo;s old dress-coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the table stood a man in his shirt sleeves; he had thrown off his
      coat; it lay upon the bed; and he was unfolding a blue paper parcel in
      which were a couple of pounds of bread, and some little sausages.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the table along with these things were a few old bits of black bread,
      and some tea in a pot. From under the bed there protruded an open
      portmanteau full of bundles of rags. In a word, the confusion and
      untidiness of the room were indescribable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It appeared to me, at the first glance, that both the man and the woman
      were respectable people, but brought to that pitch of poverty where
      untidiness seems to get the better of every effort to cope with it, till
      at last they take a sort of bitter satisfaction in it. When I entered the
      room, the man, who had entered but a moment before me, and was still
      unpacking his parcels, was saying something to his wife in an excited
      manner. The news was apparently bad, as usual, for the woman began
      whimpering. The man&rsquo;s face seemed to me to be refined and even pleasant. He
      was dark-complexioned, and about twenty-eight years of age; he wore black
      whiskers, and his lip and chin were shaved. He looked morose, but with a
      sort of pride of expression. A curious scene followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are people who find satisfaction in their own touchy feelings,
      especially when they have just taken the deepest offence; at such moments
      they feel that they would rather be offended than not. These
      easily-ignited natures, if they are wise, are always full of remorse
      afterwards, when they reflect that they have been ten times as angry as
      they need have been.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The gentleman before me gazed at me for some seconds in amazement, and
      his wife in terror; as though there was something alarmingly extraordinary
      in the fact that anyone could come to see them. But suddenly he fell upon
      me almost with fury; I had had no time to mutter more than a couple of
      words; but he had doubtless observed that I was decently dressed and,
      therefore, took deep offence because I had dared enter his den so
      unceremoniously, and spy out the squalor and untidiness of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course he was delighted to get hold of someone upon whom to vent his
      rage against things in general.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a moment I thought he would assault me; he grew so pale that he
      looked like a woman about to have hysterics; his wife was dreadfully
      alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;How dare you come in so? Be off!&rsquo; he shouted, trembling all over with
      rage and scarcely able to articulate the words. Suddenly, however, he
      observed his pocketbook in my hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I think you dropped this,&rsquo; I remarked, as quietly and drily as I could.
      (I thought it best to treat him so.) For some while he stood before me in
      downright terror, and seemed unable to understand. He then suddenly
      grabbed at his side-pocket, opened his mouth in alarm, and beat his
      forehead with his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;My God!&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;where did you find it? How?&rsquo; I explained in as few
      words as I could, and as drily as possible, how I had seen it and picked
      it up; how I had run after him, and called out to him, and how I had
      followed him upstairs and groped my way to his door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Gracious Heaven!&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;all our papers are in it! My dear sir, you
      little know what you have done for us. I should have been lost&mdash;lost!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had taken hold of the door-handle meanwhile, intending to leave the
      room without reply; but I was panting with my run upstairs, and my
      exhaustion came to a climax in a violent fit of coughing, so bad that I
      could hardly stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw how the man dashed about the room to find me an empty chair, how he
      kicked the rags off a chair which was covered up by them, brought it to
      me, and helped me to sit down; but my cough went on for another three
      minutes or so. When I came to myself he was sitting by me on another
      chair, which he had also cleared of the rubbish by throwing it all over
      the floor, and was watching me intently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you are ill?&rsquo; he remarked, in the tone which doctors use when
      they address a patient. &lsquo;I am myself a medical man&rsquo; (he did not say
      &lsquo;doctor&rsquo;), with which words he waved his hands towards the room and its
      contents as though in protest at his present condition. &lsquo;I see that you&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m in consumption,&rsquo; I said laconically, rising from my seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He jumped up, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Perhaps you are exaggerating&mdash;if you were to take proper measures
      perhaps&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was terribly confused and did not seem able to collect his scattered
      senses; the pocket-book was still in his left hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t mind me,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;Dr. B&mdash;&mdash; saw me last week&rsquo; (I
      lugged him in again), &lsquo;and my hash is quite settled; pardon me&mdash;&rsquo; I took
      hold of the door-handle again. I was on the point of opening the door and
      leaving my grateful but confused medical friend to himself and his shame,
      when my damnable cough got hold of me again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My doctor insisted on my sitting down again to get my breath. He now said
      something to his wife who, without leaving her place, addressed a few
      words of gratitude and courtesy to me. She seemed very shy over it, and
      her sickly face flushed up with confusion. I remained, but with the air of
      a man who knows he is intruding and is anxious to get away. The doctor&rsquo;s
      remorse at last seemed to need a vent, I could see.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;If I&mdash;&rsquo; he began, breaking off abruptly every other moment, and
      starting another sentence. &lsquo;I&mdash;I am so very grateful to you, and I am
      so much to blame in your eyes, I feel sure, I&mdash;you see&mdash;&rsquo; (he
      pointed to the room again) &lsquo;at this moment I am in such a position&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;there&rsquo;s nothing to see; it&rsquo;s quite a clear case&mdash;you&rsquo;ve
      lost your post and have come up to make explanations and get another, if
      you can!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;How do you know that?&rsquo; he asked in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, it was evident at the first glance,&rsquo; I said ironically, but not
      intentionally so. &lsquo;There are lots of people who come up from the provinces
      full of hope, and run about town, and have to live as best they can.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He began to talk at once excitedly and with trembling lips; he began
      complaining and telling me his story. He interested me, I confess; I sat
      there nearly an hour. His story was a very ordinary one. He had been a
      provincial doctor; he had a civil appointment, and had no sooner taken it
      up than intrigues began. Even his wife was dragged into these. He was
      proud, and flew into a passion; there was a change of local government
      which acted in favour of his opponents; his position was undermined,
      complaints were made against him; he lost his post and came up to
      Petersburg with his last remaining money, in order to appeal to higher
      authorities. Of course nobody would listen to him for a long time; he
      would come and tell his story one day and be refused promptly; another day
      he would be fed on false promises; again he would be treated harshly; then
      he would be told to sign some documents; then he would sign the paper and
      hand it in, and they would refuse to receive it, and tell him to file a
      formal petition. In a word he had been driven about from office to office
      for five months and had spent every farthing he had; his wife&rsquo;s last rags
      had just been pawned; and meanwhile a child had been born to them and&mdash;and
      today I have a final refusal to my petition, and I have hardly a crumb of
      bread left&mdash;I have nothing left; my wife has had a baby lately&mdash;and
      I&mdash;I&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He sprang up from his chair and turned away. His wife was crying in the
      corner; the child had begun to moan again. I pulled out my note-book and
      began writing in it. When I had finished and rose from my chair he was
      standing before me with an expression of alarmed curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I have jotted down your name,&rsquo; I told him, &lsquo;and all the rest of it&mdash;the
      place you served at, the district, the date, and all. I have a friend,
      Bachmatoff, whose uncle is a councillor of state and has to do with these
      matters, one Peter Matveyevitch Bachmatoff.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Peter Matveyevitch Bachmatoff!&rsquo; he cried, trembling all over with
      excitement. &lsquo;Why, nearly everything depends on that very man!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very curious, this story of the medical man, and my visit, and the
      happy termination to which I contributed by accident! Everything fitted
      in, as in a novel. I told the poor people not to put much hope in me,
      because I was but a poor schoolboy myself&mdash;(I am not really, but I
      humiliated myself as much as possible in order to make them less hopeful)&mdash;but
      that I would go at once to the Vassili Ostroff and see my friend; and that
      as I knew for certain that his uncle adored him, and was absolutely
      devoted to him as the last hope and branch of the family, perhaps the old
      man might do something to oblige his nephew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;If only they would allow me to explain all to his excellency! If I could
      but be permitted to tell my tale to him!&rdquo; he cried, trembling with
      feverish agitation, and his eyes flashing with excitement. I repeated once
      more that I could not hold out much hope&mdash;that it would probably end
      in smoke, and if I did not turn up next morning they must make up their
      minds that there was no more to be done in the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They showed me out with bows and every kind of respect; they seemed quite
      beside themselves. I shall never forget the expression of their faces!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I took a droshky and drove over to the Vassili Ostroff at once. For some
      years I had been at enmity with this young Bachmatoff, at school. We
      considered him an aristocrat; at all events I called him one. He used to
      dress smartly, and always drove to school in a private trap. He was a good
      companion, and was always merry and jolly, sometimes even witty, though he
      was not very intellectual, in spite of the fact that he was always top of
      the class; I myself was never top in anything! All his companions were
      very fond of him, excepting myself. He had several times during those
      years come up to me and tried to make friends; but I had always turned
      sulkily away and refused to have anything to do with him. I had not seen
      him for a whole year now; he was at the university. When, at nine o&rsquo;clock,
      or so, this evening, I arrived and was shown up to him with great
      ceremony, he first received me with astonishment, and not too affably, but
      he soon cheered up, and suddenly gazed intently at me and burst out
      laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Why, what on earth can have possessed you to come and see <i>me</i>,
      Terentieff?&rsquo; he cried, with his usual pleasant, sometimes audacious, but
      never offensive familiarity, which I liked in reality, but for which I
      also detested him. &lsquo;Why what&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo; he cried in alarm. &lsquo;Are you
      ill?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That confounded cough of mine had come on again; I fell into a chair, and
      with difficulty recovered my breath. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s all right, it&rsquo;s only
      consumption&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;I have come to you with a petition!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He sat down in amazement, and I lost no time in telling him the medical
      man&rsquo;s history; and explained that he, with the influence which he
      possessed over his uncle, might do some good to the poor fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll do it&mdash;I&rsquo;ll do it, of course!&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I shall attack my
      uncle about it tomorrow morning, and I&rsquo;m very glad you told me the story.
      But how was it that you thought of coming to me about it, Terentieff?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;So much depends upon your uncle,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;And besides we have always
      been enemies, Bachmatoff; and as you are a generous sort of fellow, I
      thought you would not refuse my request because I was your enemy!&rsquo; I added
      with irony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Like Napoleon going to England, eh?&rsquo; cried he, laughing. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll do it
      though&mdash;of course, and at once, if I can!&rsquo; he added, seeing that I
      rose seriously from my chair at this point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And sure enough the matter ended as satisfactorily as possible. A month
      or so later my medical friend was appointed to another post. He got his
      travelling expenses paid, and something to help him to start life with
      once more. I think Bachmatoff must have persuaded the doctor to accept a
      loan from himself. I saw Bachmatoff two or three times, about this period,
      the third time being when he gave a farewell dinner to the doctor and his
      wife before their departure, a champagne dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bachmatoff saw me home after the dinner and we crossed the Nicolai
      bridge. We were both a little drunk. He told me of his joy, the joyful
      feeling of having done a good action; he said that it was all thanks to
      myself that he could feel this satisfaction; and held forth about the
      foolishness of the theory that individual charity is useless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, too, was burning to have my say!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;In Moscow,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;there was an old state counsellor, a civil general,
      who, all his life, had been in the habit of visiting the prisons and
      speaking to criminals. Every party of convicts on its way to Siberia knew
      beforehand that on the Vorobeef Hills the &ldquo;old general&rdquo; would pay them a
      visit. He did all he undertook seriously and devotedly. He would walk down
      the rows of the unfortunate prisoners, stop before each individual and ask
      after his needs&mdash;he never sermonized them; he spoke kindly to them&mdash;he
      gave them money; he brought them all sorts of necessaries for the journey,
      and gave them devotional books, choosing those who could read, under the
      firm conviction that they would read to those who could not, as they went
      along.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;He scarcely ever talked about the particular crimes of any of them, but
      listened if any volunteered information on that point. All the convicts
      were equal for him, and he made no distinction. He spoke to all as to
      brothers, and every one of them looked upon him as a father. When he
      observed among the exiles some poor woman with a child, he would always
      come forward and fondle the little one, and make it laugh. He continued
      these acts of mercy up to his very death; and by that time all the
      criminals, all over Russia and Siberia, knew him!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;A man I knew who had been to Siberia and returned, told me that he
      himself had been a witness of how the very most hardened criminals
      remembered the old general, though, in point of fact, he could never, of
      course, have distributed more than a few pence to each member of a party.
      Their recollection of him was not sentimental or particularly devoted.
      Some wretch, for instance, who had been a murderer&mdash;cutting the
      throat of a dozen fellow-creatures, for instance; or stabbing six little
      children for his own amusement (there have been such men!)&mdash;would
      perhaps, without rhyme or reason, suddenly give a sigh and say, &ldquo;I wonder
      whether that old general is alive still!&rdquo; Although perhaps he had not
      thought of mentioning him for a dozen years before! How can one say what
      seed of good may have been dropped into his soul, never to die?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I continued in that strain for a long while, pointing out to Bachmatoff
      how impossible it is to follow up the effects of any isolated good deed
      one may do, in all its influences and subtle workings upon the heart and
      after-actions of others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;And to think that you are to be cut off from life!&rsquo; remarked Bachmatoff,
      in a tone of reproach, as though he would like to find someone to pitch
      into on my account.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were leaning over the balustrade of the bridge, looking into the Neva
      at this moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Do you know what has suddenly come into my head?&rsquo; said I, suddenly&mdash;leaning
      further and further over the rail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Surely not to throw yourself into the river?&rsquo; cried Bachmatoff in alarm.
      Perhaps he read my thought in my face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;No, not yet. At present nothing but the following consideration. You see
      I have some two or three months left me to live&mdash;perhaps four; well,
      supposing that when I have but a month or two more, I take a fancy for
      some &ldquo;good deed&rdquo; that needs both trouble and time, like this business of
      our doctor friend, for instance: why, I shall have to give up the idea of
      it and take to something else&mdash;some <i>little</i> good deed, <i>more
      within my means</i>, eh? Isn&rsquo;t that an amusing idea!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Bachmatoff was much impressed&mdash;painfully so. He took me all the
      way home; not attempting to console me, but behaving with the greatest
      delicacy. On taking leave he pressed my hand warmly and asked permission
      to come and see me. I replied that if he came to me as a &lsquo;comforter,&rsquo; so
      to speak (for he would be in that capacity whether he spoke to me in a
      soothing manner or only kept silence, as I pointed out to him), he would
      but remind me each time of my approaching death! He shrugged his
      shoulders, but quite agreed with me; and we parted better friends than I
      had expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that evening and that night were sown the first seeds of my &lsquo;last
      conviction.&rsquo; I seized greedily on my new idea; I thirstily drank in all
      its different aspects (I did not sleep a wink that night!), and the deeper
      I went into it the more my being seemed to merge itself in it, and the
      more alarmed I became. A dreadful terror came over me at last, and did not
      leave me all next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes, thinking over this, I became quite numb with the terror of it;
      and I might well have deduced from this fact, that my &lsquo;last conviction&rsquo;
      was eating into my being too fast and too seriously, and would undoubtedly
      come to its climax before long. And for the climax I needed greater
      determination than I yet possessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However, within three weeks my determination was taken, owing to a very
      strange circumstance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here on my paper, I make a note of all the figures and dates that come
      into my explanation. Of course, it is all the same to me, but just now&mdash;and
      perhaps only at this moment&mdash;I desire that all those who are to judge
      of my action should see clearly out of how logical a sequence of
      deductions has at length proceeded my &lsquo;last conviction.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have said above that the determination needed by me for the
      accomplishment of my final resolve, came to hand not through any sequence
      of causes, but thanks to a certain strange circumstance which had perhaps
      no connection whatever with the matter at issue. Ten days ago Rogojin
      called upon me about certain business of his own with which I have nothing
      to do at present. I had never seen Rogojin before, but had often heard
      about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I gave him all the information he needed, and he very soon took his
      departure; so that, since he only came for the purpose of gaining the
      information, the matter might have been expected to end there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he interested me too much, and all that day I was under the influence
      of strange thoughts connected with him, and I determined to return his
      visit the next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rogojin was evidently by no means pleased to see me, and hinted,
      delicately, that he saw no reason why our acquaintance should continue.
      For all that, however, I spent a very interesting hour, and so, I dare
      say, did he. There was so great a contrast between us that I am sure we
      must both have felt it; anyhow, I felt it acutely. Here was I, with my
      days numbered, and he, a man in the full vigour of life, living in the
      present, without the slightest thought for &lsquo;final convictions,&rsquo; or
      numbers, or days, or, in fact, for anything but that which-which&mdash;well,
      which he was mad about, if he will excuse me the expression&mdash;as a
      feeble author who cannot express his ideas properly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In spite of his lack of amiability, I could not help seeing, in Rogojin a
      man of intellect and sense; and although, perhaps, there was little in the
      outside world which was of interest to him, still he was clearly a man
      with eyes to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hinted nothing to him about my &lsquo;final conviction,&rsquo; but it appeared to
      me that he had guessed it from my words. He remained silent&mdash;he is a
      terribly silent man. I remarked to him, as I rose to depart, that, in
      spite of the contrast and the wide differences between us two, les
      extremites se touchent (&lsquo;extremes meet,&rsquo; as I explained to him in
      Russian); so that maybe he was not so far from my final conviction as
      appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His only reply to this was a sour grimace. He rose and looked for my cap,
      and placed it in my hand, and led me out of the house&mdash;that dreadful
      gloomy house of his&mdash;to all appearances, of course, as though I were
      leaving of my own accord, and he were simply seeing me to the door out of
      politeness. His house impressed me much; it is like a burial-ground, he
      seems to like it, which is, however, quite natural. Such a full life as he
      leads is so overflowing with absorbing interests that he has little need
      of assistance from his surroundings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The visit to Rogojin exhausted me terribly. Besides, I had felt ill since
      the morning; and by evening I was so weak that I took to my bed, and was
      in high fever at intervals, and even delirious. Colia sat with me until
      eleven o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet I remember all he talked about, and every word we said, though
      whenever my eyes closed for a moment I could picture nothing but the image
      of Surikoff just in the act of finding a million roubles. He could not
      make up his mind what to do with the money, and tore his hair over it. He
      trembled with fear that somebody would rob him, and at last he decided to
      bury it in the ground. I persuaded him that, instead of putting it all
      away uselessly underground, he had better melt it down and make a golden
      coffin out of it for his starved child, and then dig up the little one and
      put her into the golden coffin. Surikoff accepted this suggestion, I
      thought, with tears of gratitude, and immediately commenced to carry out
      my design.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I spat on the ground and left him in disgust. Colia told me,
      when I quite recovered my senses, that I had not been asleep for a moment,
      but that I had spoken to him about Surikoff the whole while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At moments I was in a state of dreadful weakness and misery, so that
      Colia was greatly disturbed when he left me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I arose to lock the door after him, I suddenly called to mind a
      picture I had noticed at Rogojin&rsquo;s in one of his gloomiest rooms, over the
      door. He had pointed it out to me himself as we walked past it, and I
      believe I must have stood a good five minutes in front of it. There was
      nothing artistic about it, but the picture made me feel strangely
      uncomfortable. It represented Christ just taken down from the cross. It
      seems to me that painters as a rule represent the Saviour, both on the
      cross and taken down from it, with great beauty still upon His face. This
      marvellous beauty they strive to preserve even in His moments of deepest
      agony and passion. But there was no such beauty in Rogojin&rsquo;s picture. This
      was the presentment of a poor mangled body which had evidently suffered
      unbearable anguish even before its crucifixion, full of wounds and
      bruises, marks of the violence of soldiers and people, and of the
      bitterness of the moment when He had fallen with the cross&mdash;all this
      combined with the anguish of the actual crucifixion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The face was depicted as though still suffering; as though the body, only
      just dead, was still almost quivering with agony. The picture was one of
      pure nature, for the face was not beautified by the artist, but was left
      as it would naturally be, whosoever the sufferer, after such anguish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that the earliest Christian faith taught that the Saviour suffered
      actually and not figuratively, and that nature was allowed her own way
      even while His body was on the cross.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is strange to look on this dreadful picture of the mangled corpse of
      the Saviour, and to put this question to oneself: &lsquo;Supposing that the
      disciples, the future apostles, the women who had followed Him and stood
      by the cross, all of whom believed in and worshipped Him&mdash;supposing
      that they saw this tortured body, this face so mangled and bleeding and
      bruised (and they <i>must</i> have so seen it)&mdash;how could they have
      gazed upon the dreadful sight and yet have believed that He would rise
      again?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The thought steps in, whether one likes it or no, that death is so
      terrible and so powerful, that even He who conquered it in His miracles
      during life was unable to triumph over it at the last. He who called to
      Lazarus, &lsquo;Lazarus, come forth!&rsquo; and the dead man lived&mdash;He was now
      Himself a prey to nature and death. Nature appears to one, looking at this
      picture, as some huge, implacable, dumb monster; or still better&mdash;a
      stranger simile&mdash;some enormous mechanical engine of modern days which
      has seized and crushed and swallowed up a great and invaluable Being, a
      Being worth nature and all her laws, worth the whole earth, which was
      perhaps created merely for the sake of the advent of that Being.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This blind, dumb, implacable, eternal, unreasoning force is well shown in
      the picture, and the absolute subordination of all men and things to it is
      so well expressed that the idea unconsciously arises in the mind of anyone
      who looks at it. All those faithful people who were gazing at the cross
      and its mutilated occupant must have suffered agony of mind that evening;
      for they must have felt that all their hopes and almost all their faith
      had been shattered at a blow. They must have separated in terror and dread
      that night, though each perhaps carried away with him one great thought
      which was never eradicated from his mind for ever afterwards. If this
      great Teacher of theirs could have seen Himself after the Crucifixion, how
      could He have consented to mount the Cross and to die as He did? This
      thought also comes into the mind of the man who gazes at this picture. I
      thought of all this by snatches probably between my attacks of delirium&mdash;for
      an hour and a half or so before Colia&rsquo;s departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can there be an appearance of that which has no form? And yet it seemed
      to me, at certain moments, that I beheld in some strange and impossible
      form, that dark, dumb, irresistibly powerful, eternal force.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought someone led me by the hand and showed me, by the light of a
      candle, a huge, loathsome insect, which he assured me was that very force,
      that very almighty, dumb, irresistible Power, and laughed at the
      indignation with which I received this information. In my room they always
      light the little lamp before my icon for the night; it gives a feeble
      flicker of light, but it is strong enough to see by dimly, and if you sit
      just under it you can even read by it. I think it was about twelve or a
      little past that night. I had not slept a wink, and was lying with my eyes
      wide open, when suddenly the door opened, and in came Rogojin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He entered, and shut the door behind him. Then he silently gazed at me
      and went quickly to the corner of the room where the lamp was burning and
      sat down underneath it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was much surprised, and looked at him expectantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rogojin only leaned his elbow on the table and silently stared at me. So
      passed two or three minutes, and I recollect that his silence hurt and
      offended me very much. Why did he not speak?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That his arrival at this time of night struck me as more or less strange
      may possibly be the case; but I remember I was by no means amazed at it.
      On the contrary, though I had not actually told him my thought in the
      morning, yet I know he understood it; and this thought was of such a
      character that it would not be anything very remarkable, if one were to
      come for further talk about it at any hour of night, however late.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought he must have come for this purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the morning we had parted not the best of friends; I remember he
      looked at me with disagreeable sarcasm once or twice; and this same look I
      observed in his eyes now&mdash;which was the cause of the annoyance I
      felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not for a moment suspect that I was delirious and that this Rogojin
      was but the result of fever and excitement. I had not the slightest idea
      of such a theory at first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meanwhile he continued to sit and stare jeeringly at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I angrily turned round in bed and made up my mind that I would not say a
      word unless he did; so I rested silently on my pillow determined to remain
      dumb, if it were to last till morning. I felt resolved that he should
      speak first. Probably twenty minutes or so passed in this way. Suddenly
      the idea struck me&mdash;what if this is an apparition and not Rogojin
      himself?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither during my illness nor at any previous time had I ever seen an
      apparition;&mdash;but I had always thought, both when I was a little boy,
      and even now, that if I were to see one I should die on the spot&mdash;though
      I don&rsquo;t believe in ghosts. And yet <i>now</i>, when the idea struck me
      that this was a ghost and not Rogojin at all, I was not in the least
      alarmed. Nay&mdash;the thought actually irritated me. Strangely enough,
      the decision of the question as to whether this were a ghost or Rogojin
      did not, for some reason or other, interest me nearly so much as it ought
      to have done;&mdash;I think I began to muse about something altogether
      different. For instance, I began to wonder why Rogojin, who had been in
      dressing-gown and slippers when I saw him at home, had now put on a
      dress-coat and white waistcoat and tie? I also thought to myself, I
      remember&mdash;&lsquo;if this is a ghost, and I am not afraid of it, why don&rsquo;t I
      approach it and verify my suspicions? Perhaps I am afraid&mdash;&rsquo; And no
      sooner did this last idea enter my head than an icy blast blew over me; I
      felt a chill down my backbone and my knees shook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At this very moment, as though divining my thoughts, Rogojin raised his
      head from his arm and began to part his lips as though he were going to
      laugh&mdash;but he continued to stare at me as persistently as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I felt so furious with him at this moment that I longed to rush at him;
      but as I had sworn that he should speak first, I continued to lie still&mdash;and
      the more willingly, as I was still by no means satisfied as to whether it
      really was Rogojin or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot remember how long this lasted; I cannot recollect, either,
      whether consciousness forsook me at intervals, or not. But at last Rogojin
      rose, staring at me as intently as ever, but not smiling any longer,&mdash;and
      walking very softly, almost on tip-toes, to the door, he opened it, went
      out, and shut it behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not rise from my bed, and I don&rsquo;t know how long I lay with my eyes
      open, thinking. I don&rsquo;t know what I thought about, nor how I fell asleep
      or became insensible; but I awoke next morning after nine o&rsquo;clock when
      they knocked at my door. My general orders are that if I don&rsquo;t open the
      door and call, by nine o&rsquo;clock, Matreona is to come and bring my tea. When
      I now opened the door to her, the thought suddenly struck me&mdash;how
      could he have come in, since the door was locked? I made inquiries and
      found that Rogojin himself could not possibly have come in, because all
      our doors were locked for the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, this strange circumstance&mdash;which I have described with so much
      detail&mdash;was the ultimate cause which led me to taking my final
      determination. So that no logic, or logical deductions, had anything to do
      with my resolve;&mdash;it was simply a matter of disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was impossible for me to go on living when life was full of such
      detestable, strange, tormenting forms. This ghost had humiliated me;&mdash;nor
      could I bear to be subordinate to that dark, horrible force which was
      embodied in the form of the loathsome insect. It was only towards evening,
      when I had quite made up my mind on this point, that I began to feel
      easier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <h3>
      VII.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had a small pocket pistol. I had procured it while still a boy, at that
      droll age when the stories of duels and highwaymen begin to delight one,
      and when one imagines oneself nobly standing fire at some future day, in a
      duel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There were a couple of old bullets in the bag which contained the pistol,
      and powder enough in an old flask for two or three charges.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pistol was a wretched thing, very crooked and wouldn&rsquo;t carry farther
      than fifteen paces at the most. However, it would send your skull flying
      well enough if you pressed the muzzle of it against your temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I determined to die at Pavlofsk at sunrise, in the park&mdash;so as to
      make no commotion in the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This &lsquo;explanation&rsquo; will make the matter clear enough to the police.
      Students of psychology, and anyone else who likes, may make what they
      please of it. I should not like this paper, however, to be made public. I
      request the prince to keep a copy himself, and to give a copy to Aglaya
      Ivanovna Epanchin. This is my last will and testament. As for my skeleton,
      I bequeath it to the Medical Academy for the benefit of science.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I recognize no jurisdiction over myself, and I know that I am now beyond
      the power of laws and judges.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little while ago a very amusing idea struck me. What if I were now to
      commit some terrible crime&mdash;murder ten fellow-creatures, for
      instance, or anything else that is thought most shocking and dreadful in
      this world&mdash;what a dilemma my judges would be in, with a criminal who
      only has a fortnight to live in any case, now that the rack and other
      forms of torture are abolished! Why, I should die comfortably in their own
      hospital&mdash;in a warm, clean room, with an attentive doctor&mdash;probably
      much more comfortably than I should at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand why people in my position do not oftener indulge in
      such ideas&mdash;if only for a joke! Perhaps they do! Who knows! There are
      plenty of merry souls among us!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But though I do not recognize any jurisdiction over myself, still I know
      that I shall be judged, when I am nothing but a voiceless lump of clay;
      therefore I do not wish to go before I have left a word of reply&mdash;the
      reply of a free man&mdash;not one forced to justify himself&mdash;oh no! I
      have no need to ask forgiveness of anyone. I wish to say a word merely
      because I happen to desire it of my own free will.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, in the first place, comes a strange thought!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who, in the name of what Law, would think of disputing my full personal
      right over the fortnight of life left to me? What jurisdiction can be
      brought to bear upon the case? Who would wish me, not only to be
      sentenced, but to endure the sentence to the end? Surely there exists no
      man who would wish such a thing&mdash;why should anyone desire it? For the
      sake of morality? Well, I can understand that if I were to make an attempt
      upon my own life while in the enjoyment of full health and vigour&mdash;my
      life which might have been &lsquo;useful,&rsquo; etc., etc.&mdash;morality might
      reproach me, according to the old routine, for disposing of my life
      without permission&mdash;or whatever its tenet may be. But now, <i>now</i>,
      when my sentence is out and my days numbered! How can morality have need
      of my last breaths, and why should I die listening to the consolations
      offered by the prince, who, without doubt, would not omit to demonstrate
      that death is actually a benefactor to me? (Christians like him always end
      up with that&mdash;it is their pet theory.) And what do they want with
      their ridiculous &lsquo;Pavlofsk trees&rsquo;? To sweeten my last hours? Cannot they
      understand that the more I forget myself, the more I let myself become
      attached to these last illusions of life and love, by means of which they
      try to hide from me Meyer&rsquo;s wall, and all that is so plainly written on it&mdash;the
      more unhappy they make me? What is the use of all your nature to me&mdash;all
      your parks and trees, your sunsets and sunrises, your blue skies and your
      self-satisfied faces&mdash;when all this wealth of beauty and happiness
      begins with the fact that it accounts me&mdash;only me&mdash;one too many!
      What is the good of all this beauty and glory to me, when every second,
      every moment, I cannot but be aware that this little fly which buzzes
      around my head in the sun&rsquo;s rays&mdash;even this little fly is a sharer
      and participator in all the glory of the universe, and knows its place and
      is happy in it;&mdash;while I&mdash;only I, am an outcast, and have been
      blind to the fact hitherto, thanks to my simplicity! Oh! I know well how
      the prince and others would like me, instead of indulging in all these
      wicked words of my own, to sing, to the glory and triumph of morality,
      that well-known verse of Gilbert&rsquo;s:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"><i>
  &ldquo;&lsquo;O, puissent voir longtemps votre beauté sacrée
    Tant d&rsquo;amis, sourds à mes adieux!
    Qu&rsquo;ils meurent pleins de jours, que leur mort soit pleurée,
    Qu&rsquo;un ami leur ferme les yeux!&rsquo;
</i></pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But believe me, believe me, my simple-hearted friends, that in this
      highly moral verse, in this academical blessing to the world in general in
      the French language, is hidden the intensest gall and bitterness; but so
      well concealed is the venom, that I dare say the poet actually persuaded
      himself that his words were full of the tears of pardon and peace, instead
      of the bitterness of disappointment and malice, and so died in the
      delusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know there is a limit of ignominy, beyond which man&rsquo;s
      consciousness of shame cannot go, and after which begins satisfaction in
      shame? Well, of course humility is a great force in that sense, I admit
      that&mdash;though not in the sense in which religion accounts humility to
      be strength!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Religion!&mdash;I admit eternal life&mdash;and perhaps I always did admit
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Admitted that consciousness is called into existence by the will of a
      Higher Power; admitted that this consciousness looks out upon the world
      and says &lsquo;I am;&rsquo; and admitted that the Higher Power wills that the
      consciousness so called into existence, be suddenly extinguished (for so&mdash;for
      some unexplained reason&mdash;it is and must be)&mdash;still there comes
      the eternal question&mdash;why must I be humble through all this? Is it
      not enough that I am devoured, without my being expected to bless the
      power that devours me? Surely&mdash;surely I need not suppose that
      Somebody&mdash;there&mdash;will be offended because I do not wish to live
      out the fortnight allowed me? I don&rsquo;t believe it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is much simpler, and far more likely, to believe that my death is
      needed&mdash;the death of an insignificant atom&mdash;in order to fulfil
      the general harmony of the universe&mdash;in order to make even some plus
      or minus in the sum of existence. Just as every day the death of numbers
      of beings is necessary because without their annihilation the rest cannot
      live on&mdash;(although we must admit that the idea is not a particularly
      grand one in itself!)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However&mdash;admit the fact! Admit that without such perpetual devouring
      of one another the world cannot continue to exist, or could never have
      been organized&mdash;I am ever ready to confess that I cannot understand
      why this is so&mdash;but I&rsquo;ll tell you what I <i>do</i> know, for certain.
      If I have once been given to understand and realize that I <i>am</i>&mdash;what
      does it matter to me that the world is organized on a system full of
      errors and that otherwise it cannot be organized at all? Who will or can
      judge me after this? Say what you like&mdash;the thing is impossible and
      unjust!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And meanwhile I have never been able, in spite of my great desire to do
      so, to persuade myself that there is no future existence, and no
      Providence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact of the matter is that all this <i>does</i> exist, but that we
      know absolutely nothing about the future life and its laws!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is so difficult, and even impossible to understand, that surely I
      am not to be blamed because I could not fathom the incomprehensible?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I know they say that one must be obedient, and of course, too,
      the prince is one of those who say so: that one must be obedient without
      questions, out of pure goodness of heart, and that for my worthy conduct
      in this matter I shall meet with reward in another world. We degrade God
      when we attribute our own ideas to Him, out of annoyance that we cannot
      fathom His ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Again, I repeat, I cannot be blamed because I am unable to understand
      that which it is not given to mankind to fathom. Why am I to be judged
      because I could not comprehend the Will and Laws of Providence? No, we had
      better drop religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And enough of this. By the time I have got so far in the reading of my
      document the sun will be up and the huge force of his rays will be acting
      upon the living world. So be it. I shall die gazing straight at the great
      Fountain of life and power; I do not want this life!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had had the power to prevent my own birth I should certainly never
      have consented to accept existence under such ridiculous conditions.
      However, I have the power to end my existence, although I do but give back
      days that are already numbered. It is an insignificant gift, and my revolt
      is equally insignificant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Final explanation: I die, not in the least because I am unable to support
      these next three weeks. Oh no, I should find strength enough, and if I
      wished it I could obtain consolation from the thought of the injury that
      is done me. But I am not a French poet, and I do not desire such
      consolation. And finally, nature has so limited my capacity for work or
      activity of any kind, in allotting me but three weeks of time, that
      suicide is about the only thing left that I can begin and end in the time
      of my own free will.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps then I am anxious to take advantage of my last chance of doing
      something for myself. A protest is sometimes no small thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The explanation was finished; Hippolyte paused at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is, in extreme cases, a final stage of cynical candour when a
      nervous man, excited, and beside himself with emotion, will be afraid of
      nothing and ready for any sort of scandal, nay, glad of it. The
      extraordinary, almost unnatural, tension of the nerves which upheld
      Hippolyte up to this point, had now arrived at this final stage. This poor
      feeble boy of eighteen&mdash;exhausted by disease&mdash;looked for all the
      world as weak and frail as a leaflet torn from its parent tree and
      trembling in the breeze; but no sooner had his eye swept over his
      audience, for the first time during the whole of the last hour, than the
      most contemptuous, the most haughty expression of repugnance lighted up
      his face. He defied them all, as it were. But his hearers were indignant,
      too; they rose to their feet with annoyance. Fatigue, the wine consumed,
      the strain of listening so long, all added to the disagreeable impression
      which the reading had made upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Hippolyte jumped up as though he had been shot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sun is rising,&rdquo; he cried, seeing the gilded tops of the trees, and
      pointing to them as to a miracle. &ldquo;See, it is rising now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what then? Did you suppose it wasn&rsquo;t going to rise?&rdquo; asked
      Ferdishenko.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be atrociously hot again all day,&rdquo; said Gania, with an air
      of annoyance, taking his hat. &ldquo;A month of this... Are you coming home,
      Ptitsin?&rdquo; Hippolyte listened to this in amazement, almost amounting to
      stupefaction. Suddenly he became deadly pale and shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You manage your composure too awkwardly. I see you wish to insult me,&rdquo; he
      cried to Gania. &ldquo;You&mdash;you are a cur!&rdquo; He looked at Gania with an
      expression of malice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth is the matter with the boy? What phenomenal
      feeble-mindedness!&rdquo; exclaimed Ferdishenko.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s simply a fool,&rdquo; said Gania.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hippolyte braced himself up a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand, gentlemen,&rdquo; he began, trembling as before, and stumbling
      over every word, &ldquo;that I have deserved your resentment, and&mdash;and am
      sorry that I should have troubled you with this raving nonsense&rdquo; (pointing
      to his article), &ldquo;or rather, I am sorry that I have not troubled you
      enough.&rdquo; He smiled feebly. &ldquo;Have I troubled you, Evgenie Pavlovitch?&rdquo; He
      suddenly turned on Evgenie with this question. &ldquo;Tell me now, have I
      troubled you or not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it was a little drawn out, perhaps; but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, speak out! Don&rsquo;t lie, for once in your life&mdash;speak out!&rdquo;
       continued Hippolyte, quivering with agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my good sir, I assure you it&rsquo;s entirely the same to me. Please leave
      me in peace,&rdquo; said Evgenie, angrily, turning his back on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, prince,&rdquo; said Ptitsin, approaching his host.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you thinking of? Don&rsquo;t go, he&rsquo;ll blow his brains out in a
      minute!&rdquo; cried Vera Lebedeff, rushing up to Hippolyte and catching hold of
      his hands in a torment of alarm. &ldquo;What are you thinking of? He said he
      would blow his brains out at sunrise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he won&rsquo;t shoot himself!&rdquo; cried several voices, sarcastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, you&rsquo;d better look out,&rdquo; cried Colia, also seizing Hippolyte by
      the hand. &ldquo;Just look at him! Prince, what are you thinking of?&rdquo; Vera and
      Colia, and Keller, and Burdovsky were all crowding round Hippolyte now and
      holding him down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has the right&mdash;the right&mdash;&rdquo; murmured Burdovsky. &ldquo;Excuse me,
      prince, but what are your arrangements?&rdquo; asked Lebedeff, tipsy and
      exasperated, going up to Muishkin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by &lsquo;arrangements&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, excuse me! I&rsquo;m master of this house, though I do not wish to lack
      respect towards you. You are master of the house too, in a way; but I
      can&rsquo;t allow this sort of thing&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t shoot himself; the boy is only playing the fool,&rdquo; said General
      Ivolgin, suddenly and unexpectedly, with indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know he won&rsquo;t, I know he won&rsquo;t, general; but I&mdash;I&rsquo;m master here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, Mr. Terentieff,&rdquo; said Ptitsin, who had bidden the prince
      good-night, and was now holding out his hand to Hippolyte; &ldquo;I think you
      remark in that manuscript of yours, that you bequeath your skeleton to the
      Academy. Are you referring to your own skeleton&mdash;I mean, your very
      bones?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my bones, I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so, I see; because, you know, little mistakes have occurred now and
      then. There was a case&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you tease him?&rdquo; cried the prince, suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve moved him to tears,&rdquo; added Ferdishenko. But Hippolyte was by no
      means weeping. He was about to move from his place, when his four guards
      rushed at him and seized him once more. There was a laugh at this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He led up to this on purpose. He took the trouble of writing all that so
      that people should come and grab him by the arm,&rdquo; observed Rogojin.
      &ldquo;Good-night, prince. What a time we&rsquo;ve sat here, my very bones ache!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you really intended to shoot yourself, Terentieff,&rdquo; said Evgenie
      Pavlovitch, laughing, &ldquo;if I were you, after all these compliments, I
      should just not shoot myself in order to vex them all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are very anxious to see me blow my brains out,&rdquo; said Hippolyte,
      bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, they&rsquo;ll be awfully annoyed if they don&rsquo;t see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you think they won&rsquo;t see it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not trying to egg you on. On the contrary, I think it very likely
      that you may shoot yourself; but the principal thing is to keep cool,&rdquo;
       said Evgenie with a drawl, and with great condescension.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only now perceive what a terrible mistake I made in reading this
      article to them,&rdquo; said Hippolyte, suddenly, addressing Evgenie, and
      looking at him with an expression of trust and confidence, as though he
      were applying to a friend for counsel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s a droll situation; I really don&rsquo;t know what advice to give
      you,&rdquo; replied Evgenie, laughing. Hippolyte gazed steadfastly at him, but
      said nothing. To look at him one might have supposed that he was
      unconscious at intervals.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; said Lebedeff, &ldquo;but did you observe the young gentleman&rsquo;s
      style? &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go and blow my brains out in the park,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;so as not
      to disturb anyone.&rsquo; He thinks he won&rsquo;t disturb anybody if he goes three
      yards away, into the park, and blows his brains out there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen&mdash;&rdquo; began the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, excuse me, most revered prince,&rdquo; Lebedeff interrupted, excitedly.
      &ldquo;Since you must have observed yourself that this is no joke, and since at
      least half your guests must also have concluded that after all that has
      been said this youth <i>must</i> blow his brains out for honour&rsquo;s sake&mdash;I&mdash;as
      master of this house, and before these witnesses, now call upon you to
      take steps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but what am I to do, Lebedeff? What steps am I to take? I am ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you. In the first place he must immediately deliver up the
      pistol which he boasted of, with all its appurtenances. If he does this I
      shall consent to his being allowed to spend the night in this house&mdash;considering
      his feeble state of health, and of course conditionally upon his being
      under proper supervision. But tomorrow he must go elsewhere. Excuse me,
      prince! Should he refuse to deliver up his weapon, then I shall instantly
      seize one of his arms and General Ivolgin the other, and we shall hold him
      until the police arrive and take the matter into their own hands. Mr.
      Ferdishenko will kindly fetch them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this there was a dreadful noise; Lebedeff danced about in his
      excitement; Ferdishenko prepared to go for the police; Gania frantically
      insisted that it was all nonsense, &ldquo;for nobody was going to shoot
      themselves.&rdquo; Evgenie Pavlovitch said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prince,&rdquo; whispered Hippolyte, suddenly, his eyes all ablaze, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t
      suppose that I did not foresee all this hatred?&rdquo; He looked at the prince
      as though he expected him to reply, for a moment. &ldquo;Enough!&rdquo; he added at
      length, and addressing the whole company, he cried: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all my fault,
      gentlemen! Lebedeff, here&rsquo;s the key,&rdquo; (he took out a small bunch of keys);
      &ldquo;this one, the last but one&mdash;Colia will show you&mdash;Colia, where&rsquo;s
      Colia?&rdquo; he cried, looking straight at Colia and not seeing him. &ldquo;Yes,
      he&rsquo;ll show you; he packed the bag with me this morning. Take him up,
      Colia; my bag is upstairs in the prince&rsquo;s study, under the table. Here&rsquo;s
      the key, and in the little case you&rsquo;ll find my pistol and the powder, and
      all. Colia packed it himself, Mr. Lebedeff; he&rsquo;ll show you; but it&rsquo;s on
      condition that tomorrow morning, when I leave for Petersburg, you will
      give me back my pistol, do you hear? I do this for the prince&rsquo;s sake, not
      yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Capital, that&rsquo;s much better!&rdquo; cried Lebedeff, and seizing the key he made
      off in haste.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colia stopped a moment as though he wished to say something; but Lebedeff
      dragged him away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hippolyte looked around at the laughing guests. The prince observed that
      his teeth were chattering as though in a violent attack of ague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What brutes they all are!&rdquo; he whispered to the prince. Whenever he
      addressed him he lowered his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let them alone, you&rsquo;re too weak now&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, directly; I&rsquo;ll go away directly. I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he embraced Muishkin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you think I am mad, eh?&rdquo; he asked him, laughing very strangely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Directly, directly! Stand still a moment, I wish to look in your eyes;
      don&rsquo;t speak&mdash;stand so&mdash;let me look at you! I am bidding farewell
      to mankind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood so for ten seconds, gazing at the prince, motionless, deadly
      pale, his temples wet with perspiration; he held the prince&rsquo;s hand in a
      strange grip, as though afraid to let him go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hippolyte, Hippolyte, what is the matter with you?&rdquo; cried Muishkin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Directly! There, that&rsquo;s enough. I&rsquo;ll lie down directly. I must drink to
      the sun&rsquo;s health. I wish to&mdash;I insist upon it! Let go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seized a glass from the table, broke away from the prince, and in a
      moment had reached the terrace steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince made after him, but it so happened that at this moment Evgenie
      Pavlovitch stretched out his hand to say good-night. The next instant
      there was a general outcry, and then followed a few moments of
      indescribable excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reaching the steps, Hippolyte had paused, holding the glass in his left
      hand while he put his right hand into his coat pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keller insisted afterwards that he had held his right hand in his pocket
      all the while, when he was speaking to the prince, and that he had held
      the latter&rsquo;s shoulder with his left hand only. This circumstance, Keller
      affirmed, had led him to feel some suspicion from the first. However this
      may be, Keller ran after Hippolyte, but he was too late.
    </p>
    <p>
      He caught sight of something flashing in Hippolyte&rsquo;s right hand, and saw
      that it was a pistol. He rushed at him, but at that very instant Hippolyte
      raised the pistol to his temple and pulled the trigger. There followed a
      sharp metallic click, but no report.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Keller seized the would-be suicide, the latter fell forward into his
      arms, probably actually believing that he was shot. Keller had hold of the
      pistol now. Hippolyte was immediately placed in a chair, while the whole
      company thronged around excitedly, talking and asking each other
      questions. Every one of them had heard the snap of the trigger, and yet
      they saw a live and apparently unharmed man before them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hippolyte himself sat quite unconscious of what was going on, and gazed
      around with a senseless expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lebedeff and Colia came rushing up at this moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; someone asked, breathlessly&mdash;&ldquo;A misfire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it wasn&rsquo;t loaded,&rdquo; said several voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s loaded all right,&rdquo; said Keller, examining the pistol, &ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! did it miss fire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was no cap in it,&rdquo; Keller announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be difficult to describe the pitiable scene that now followed.
      The first sensation of alarm soon gave place to amusement; some burst out
      laughing loud and heartily, and seemed to find a malicious satisfaction in
      the joke. Poor Hippolyte sobbed hysterically; he wrung his hands; he
      approached everyone in turn&mdash;even Ferdishenko&mdash;and took them by
      both hands, and swore solemnly that he had forgotten&mdash;absolutely
      forgotten&mdash;&ldquo;accidentally, and not on purpose,&rdquo;&mdash;to put a cap in&mdash;that
      he &ldquo;had ten of them, at least, in his pocket.&rdquo; He pulled them out and
      showed them to everyone; he protested that he had not liked to put one in
      beforehand for fear of an accidental explosion in his pocket. That he had
      thought he would have lots of time to put it in afterwards&mdash;when
      required&mdash;and, that, in the heat of the moment, he had forgotten all
      about it. He threw himself upon the prince, then on Evgenie Pavlovitch. He
      entreated Keller to give him back the pistol, and he&rsquo;d soon show them all
      that &ldquo;his honour&mdash;his honour,&rdquo;&mdash;but he was &ldquo;dishonoured, now,
      for ever!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He fell senseless at last&mdash;and was carried into the prince&rsquo;s study.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lebedeff, now quite sobered down, sent for a doctor; and he and his
      daughter, with Burdovsky and General Ivolgin, remained by the sick man&rsquo;s
      couch.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was carried away unconscious, Keller stood in the middle of the
      room, and made the following declaration to the company in general, in a
      loud tone of voice, with emphasis upon each word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, if any one of you casts any doubt again, before me, upon
      Hippolyte&rsquo;s good faith, or hints that the cap was forgotten intentionally,
      or suggests that this unhappy boy was acting a part before us, I beg to
      announce that the person so speaking shall account to me for his words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No one replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      The company departed very quickly, in a mass. Ptitsin, Gania, and Rogojin
      went away together.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince was much astonished that Evgenie Pavlovitch changed his mind,
      and took his departure without the conversation he had requested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you wished to have a talk with me when the others left?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; said Evgenie, sitting down suddenly beside him, &ldquo;but I have
      changed my mind for the time being. I confess, I am too disturbed, and so,
      I think, are you; and the matter as to which I wished to consult you is
      too serious to tackle with one&rsquo;s mind even a little disturbed; too serious
      both for myself and for you. You see, prince, for once in my life I wish
      to perform an absolutely honest action, that is, an action with no
      ulterior motive; and I think I am hardly in a condition to talk of it just
      at this moment, and&mdash;and&mdash;well, we&rsquo;ll discuss it another time.
      Perhaps the matter may gain in clearness if we wait for two or three days&mdash;just
      the two or three days which I must spend in Petersburg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here he rose again from his chair, so that it seemed strange that he
      should have thought it worth while to sit down at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince thought, too, that he looked vexed and annoyed, and not nearly
      so friendly towards himself as he had been earlier in the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you will go to the sufferer&rsquo;s bedside now?&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am afraid...&rdquo; began the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you needn&rsquo;t fear! He&rsquo;ll live another six weeks all right. Very likely
      he will recover altogether; but I strongly advise you to pack him off
      tomorrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I may have offended him by saying nothing just now. I am afraid
      he may suspect that I doubted his good faith,&mdash;about shooting
      himself, you know. What do you think, Evgenie Pavlovitch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit of it! You are much too good to him; you shouldn&rsquo;t care a hang
      about what he thinks. I have heard of such things before, but never came
      across, till tonight, a man who would actually shoot himself in order to
      gain a vulgar notoriety, or blow out his brains for spite, if he finds
      that people don&rsquo;t care to pat him on the back for his sanguinary
      intentions. But what astonishes me more than anything is the fellow&rsquo;s
      candid confession of weakness. You&rsquo;d better get rid of him tomorrow, in
      any case.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think he will make another attempt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no, not he, not now! But you have to be very careful with this sort of
      gentleman. Crime is too often the last resource of these petty
      nonentities. This young fellow is quite capable of cutting the throats of
      ten people, simply for a lark, as he told us in his &lsquo;explanation.&rsquo; I
      assure you those confounded words of his will not let me sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you disturb yourself too much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an extraordinary person you are, prince! Do you mean to say that you
      doubt the fact that he is capable of murdering ten men?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daren&rsquo;t say, one way or the other; all this is very strange&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, as you like, just as you like,&rdquo; said Evgenie Pavlovitch, irritably.
      &ldquo;Only you are such a plucky fellow, take care you don&rsquo;t get included among
      the ten victims!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he is much more likely not to kill anyone at all,&rdquo; said the prince,
      gazing thoughtfully at Evgenie. The latter laughed disagreeably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, <i>au revoir!</i> Did you observe that he &lsquo;willed&rsquo; a copy of his
      confession to Aglaya Ivanovna?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I did; I am thinking of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In connection with &lsquo;the ten,&rsquo; eh?&rdquo; laughed Evgenie, as he left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later, towards four o&rsquo;clock, the prince went into the park. He had
      endeavoured to fall asleep, but could not, owing to the painful beating of
      his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had left things quiet and peaceful; the invalid was fast asleep, and
      the doctor, who had been called in, had stated that there was no special
      danger. Lebedeff, Colia, and Burdovsky were lying down in the sick-room,
      ready to take it in turns to watch. There was nothing to fear, therefore,
      at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the prince&rsquo;s mental perturbation increased every moment. He wandered
      about the park, looking absently around him, and paused in astonishment
      when he suddenly found himself in the empty space with the rows of chairs
      round it, near the Vauxhall. The look of the place struck him as dreadful
      now: so he turned round and went by the path which he had followed with
      the Epanchins on the way to the band, until he reached the green bench
      which Aglaya had pointed out for their rendezvous. He sat down on it and
      suddenly burst into a loud fit of laughter, immediately followed by a
      feeling of irritation. His disturbance of mind continued; he felt that he
      must go away somewhere, anywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Above his head some little bird sang out, of a sudden; he began to peer
      about for it among the leaves. Suddenly the bird darted out of the tree
      and away, and instantly he thought of the &ldquo;fly buzzing about in the sun&rsquo;s
      rays&rdquo; that Hippolyte had talked of; how that it knew its place and was a
      participator in the universal life, while he alone was an &ldquo;outcast.&rdquo; This
      picture had impressed him at the time, and he meditated upon it now. An
      old, forgotten memory awoke in his brain, and suddenly burst into
      clearness and light. It was a recollection of Switzerland, during the
      first year of his cure, the very first months. At that time he had been
      pretty nearly an idiot still; he could not speak properly, and had
      difficulty in understanding when others spoke to him. He climbed the
      mountain-side, one sunny morning, and wandered long and aimlessly with a
      certain thought in his brain, which would not become clear. Above him was
      the blazing sky, below, the lake; all around was the horizon, clear and
      infinite. He looked out upon this, long and anxiously. He remembered how
      he had stretched out his arms towards the beautiful, boundless blue of the
      horizon, and wept, and wept. What had so tormented him was the idea that
      he was a stranger to all this, that he was outside this glorious festival.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was this universe? What was this grand, eternal pageant to which he
      had yearned from his childhood up, and in which he could never take part?
      Every morning the same magnificent sun; every morning the same rainbow in
      the waterfall; every evening the same glow on the snow-mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every little fly that buzzed in the sun&rsquo;s rays was a singer in the
      universal chorus, &ldquo;knew its place, and was happy in it.&rdquo; Every blade of
      grass grew and was happy. Everything knew its path and loved it, went
      forth with a song and returned with a song; only he knew nothing,
      understood nothing, neither men nor words, nor any of nature&rsquo;s voices; he
      was a stranger and an outcast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, he could not then speak these words, or express all he felt! He had
      been tormented dumbly; but now it appeared to him that he must have said
      these very words&mdash;even then&mdash;and that Hippolyte must have taken
      his picture of the little fly from his tears and words of that time.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was sure of it, and his heart beat excitedly at the thought, he knew
      not why.
    </p>
    <p>
      He fell asleep on the bench; but his mental disquiet continued through his
      slumbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just before he dozed off, the idea of Hippolyte murdering ten men flitted
      through his brain, and he smiled at the absurdity of such a thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Around him all was quiet; only the flutter and whisper of the leaves broke
      the silence, but broke it only to cause it to appear yet more deep and
      still.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dreamed many dreams as he sat there, and all were full of disquiet, so
      that he shuddered every moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length a woman seemed to approach him. He knew her, oh! he knew her
      only too well. He could always name her and recognize her anywhere; but,
      strange, she seemed to have quite a different face from hers, as he had
      known it, and he felt a tormenting desire to be able to say she was not
      the same woman. In the face before him there was such dreadful remorse and
      horror that he thought she must be a criminal, that she must have just
      committed some awful crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tears were trembling on her white cheek. She beckoned him, but placed her
      finger on her lip as though to warn him that he must follow her very
      quietly. His heart froze within him. He wouldn&rsquo;t, he <i>couldn&rsquo;t</i>
      confess her to be a criminal, and yet he felt that something dreadful
      would happen the next moment, something which would blast his whole life.
    </p>
    <p>
      She seemed to wish to show him something, not far off, in the park.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose from his seat in order to follow her, when a bright, clear peal of
      laughter rang out by his side. He felt somebody&rsquo;s hand suddenly in his
      own, seized it, pressed it hard, and awoke. Before him stood Aglaya,
      laughing aloud.
    </p>
    <h3>
      VIII.
    </h3>
    <p>
      She laughed, but she was rather angry too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s asleep! You were asleep,&rdquo; she said, with contemptuous surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it really you?&rdquo; muttered the prince, not quite himself as yet, and
      recognizing her with a start of amazement. &ldquo;Oh yes, of course,&rdquo; he added,
      &ldquo;this is our rendezvous. I fell asleep here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I saw.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did no one awake me besides yourself? Was there no one else here? I
      thought there was another woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was another woman here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At last he was wide awake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a dream, of course,&rdquo; he said, musingly. &ldquo;Strange that I should
      have a dream like that at such a moment. Sit down&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took her hand and seated her on the bench; then sat down beside her and
      reflected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aglaya did not begin the conversation, but contented herself with watching
      her companion intently.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked back at her, but at times it was clear that he did not see her
      and was not thinking of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aglaya began to flush up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes!&rdquo; cried the prince, starting. &ldquo;Hippolyte&rsquo;s suicide&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? At your house?&rdquo; she asked, but without much surprise. &ldquo;He was alive
      yesterday evening, wasn&rsquo;t he? How could you sleep here after that?&rdquo; she
      cried, growing suddenly animated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but he didn&rsquo;t kill himself; the pistol didn&rsquo;t go off.&rdquo; Aglaya
      insisted on hearing the whole story. She hurried the prince along, but
      interrupted him with all sorts of questions, nearly all of which were
      irrelevant. Among other things, she seemed greatly interested in every
      word that Evgenie Pavlovitch had said, and made the prince repeat that
      part of the story over and over again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;ll do; we must be quick,&rdquo; she concluded, after hearing all.
      &ldquo;We have only an hour here, till eight; I must be home by then without
      fail, so that they may not find out that I came and sat here with you; but
      I&rsquo;ve come on business. I have a great deal to say to you. But you have
      bowled me over considerably with your news. As to Hippolyte, I think his
      pistol was bound not to go off; it was more consistent with the whole
      affair. Are you sure he really wished to blow his brains out, and that
      there was no humbug about the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No humbug at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely. So he wrote that you were to bring me a copy of his
      confession, did he? Why didn&rsquo;t you bring it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, he didn&rsquo;t die! I&rsquo;ll ask him for it, if you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring it by all means; you needn&rsquo;t ask him. He will be delighted, you may
      be sure; for, in all probability, he shot at himself simply in order that
      I might read his confession. Don&rsquo;t laugh at what I say, please, Lef
      Nicolaievitch, because it may very well be the case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not laughing. I am convinced, myself, that that may have been partly
      the reason.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are convinced? You don&rsquo;t really mean to say you think that honestly?&rdquo;
       asked Aglaya, extremely surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      She put her questions very quickly and talked fast, every now and then
      forgetting what she had begun to say, and not finishing her sentence. She
      seemed to be impatient to warn the prince about something or other. She
      was in a state of unusual excitement, and though she put on a brave and
      even defiant air, she seemed to be rather alarmed. She was dressed very
      simply, but this suited her well. She continually trembled and blushed,
      and she sat on the very edge of the seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact that the prince confirmed her idea, about Hippolyte shooting
      himself that she might read his confession, surprised her greatly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; added the prince, &ldquo;he wished us all to applaud his conduct&mdash;besides
      yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you mean&mdash;applaud?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;how am I to explain? He was very anxious that we should all
      come around him, and say we were so sorry for him, and that we loved him
      very much, and all that; and that we hoped he wouldn&rsquo;t kill himself, but
      remain alive. Very likely he thought more of you than the rest of us,
      because he mentioned you at such a moment, though perhaps he did not know
      himself that he had you in his mind&rsquo;s eye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you. How could he have me in view, and not be aware of
      it himself? And yet, I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;perhaps I do. Do you know I have
      intended to poison myself at least thirty times&mdash;ever since I was
      thirteen or so&mdash;and to write to my parents before I did it? I used to
      think how nice it would be to lie in my coffin, and have them all weeping
      over me and saying it was all their fault for being so cruel, and all that&mdash;what
      are you smiling at?&rdquo; she added, knitting her brow. &ldquo;What do <i>you</i>
      think of when you go mooning about alone? I suppose you imagine yourself a
      field-marshal, and think you have conquered Napoleon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I really have thought something of the sort now and then,
      especially when just dozing off,&rdquo; laughed the prince. &ldquo;Only it is the
      Austrians whom I conquer&mdash;not Napoleon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wish to joke with you, Lef Nicolaievitch. I shall see Hippolyte
      myself. Tell him so. As for you, I think you are behaving very badly,
      because it is not right to judge a man&rsquo;s soul as you are judging
      Hippolyte&rsquo;s. You have no gentleness, but only justice&mdash;so you are
      unjust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince reflected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you are unfair towards me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There is nothing wrong in
      the thoughts I ascribe to Hippolyte; they are only natural. But of course
      I don&rsquo;t know for certain what he thought. Perhaps he thought nothing, but
      simply longed to see human faces once more, and to hear human praise and
      feel human affection. Who knows? Only it all came out wrong, somehow. Some
      people have luck, and everything comes out right with them; others have
      none, and never a thing turns out fortunately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you have felt that in your own case,&rdquo; said Aglaya.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have,&rdquo; replied the prince, quite unsuspicious of any irony in the
      remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m&mdash;well, at all events, I shouldn&rsquo;t have fallen asleep here, in
      your place. It wasn&rsquo;t nice of you, that. I suppose you fall asleep
      wherever you sit down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t sleep a wink all night. I walked and walked about, and went
      to where the music was&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What music?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where they played last night. Then I found this bench and sat down, and
      thought and thought&mdash;and at last I fell fast asleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, is that it? That makes a difference, perhaps. What did you go to the
      bandstand for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well&mdash;afterwards. You are always interrupting me. What woman
      was it you were dreaming about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was&mdash;about&mdash;you saw her&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so; I understand. I understand quite well. You are very&mdash;Well,
      how did she appear to you? What did she look like? No, I don&rsquo;t want to
      know anything about her,&rdquo; said Aglaya, angrily; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t interrupt me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused a moment as though getting breath, or trying to master her
      feeling of annoyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here; this is what I called you here for. I wish to make you a&mdash;to
      ask you to be my friend. What do you stare at me like that for?&rdquo; she
      added, almost angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince certainly had darted a rather piercing look at her, and now
      observed that she had begun to blush violently. At such moments, the more
      Aglaya blushed, the angrier she grew with herself; and this was clearly
      expressed in her eyes, which flashed like fire. As a rule, she vented her
      wrath on her unfortunate companion, be it who it might. She was very
      conscious of her own shyness, and was not nearly so talkative as her
      sisters for this reason&mdash;in fact, at times she was much too quiet.
      When, therefore, she was bound to talk, especially at such delicate
      moments as this, she invariably did so with an air of haughty defiance.
      She always knew beforehand when she was going to blush, long before the
      blush came.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you do not wish to accept my proposition?&rdquo; she asked, gazing
      haughtily at the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, I do; but it is so unnecessary. I mean, I did not think you need
      make such a proposition,&rdquo; said the prince, looking confused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you suppose, then? Why did you think I invited you out here? I
      suppose you think me a &lsquo;little fool,&rsquo; as they all call me at home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know they called you a fool. I certainly don&rsquo;t think you one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think me one! Oh, dear me!&mdash;that&rsquo;s very clever of you; you
      put it so neatly, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my opinion, you are far from a fool sometimes&mdash;in fact, you are
      very intelligent. You said a very clever thing just now about my being
      unjust because I had <i>only</i> justice. I shall remember that, and think
      about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aglaya blushed with pleasure. All these changes in her expression came
      about so naturally and so rapidly&mdash;they delighted the prince; he
      watched her, and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; she began again; &ldquo;I have long waited to tell you all this, ever
      since the time when you sent me that letter&mdash;even before that. Half
      of what I have to say you heard yesterday. I consider you the most honest
      and upright of men&mdash;more honest and upright than any other man; and
      if anybody says that your mind is&mdash;is sometimes affected, you know&mdash;it
      is unfair. I always say so and uphold it, because even if your surface
      mind be a little affected (of course you will not feel angry with me for
      talking so&mdash;I am speaking from a higher point of view) yet your real
      mind is far better than all theirs put together. Such a mind as they have
      never even <i>dreamed</i> of; because really, there are <i>two</i> minds&mdash;the
      kind that matters, and the kind that doesn&rsquo;t matter. Isn&rsquo;t it so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May be! may be so!&rdquo; said the prince, faintly; his heart was beating
      painfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew you would not misunderstand me,&rdquo; she said, triumphantly. &ldquo;Prince
      S. and Evgenie Pavlovitch and Alexandra don&rsquo;t understand anything about
      these two kinds of mind, but, just fancy, mamma does!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very like Lizabetha Prokofievna.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! surely not?&rdquo; said Aglaya.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you are, indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you; I am glad to be like mamma,&rdquo; she said, thoughtfully. &ldquo;You
      respect her very much, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she added, quite unconscious of the
      naiveness of the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Very</i> much; and I am so glad that you have realized the fact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very glad, too, because she is often laughed at by people. But
      listen to the chief point. I have long thought over the matter, and at
      last I have chosen you. I don&rsquo;t wish people to laugh at me; I don&rsquo;t wish
      people to think me a &lsquo;little fool.&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t want to be chaffed. I felt all
      this of a sudden, and I refused Evgenie Pavlovitch flatly, because I am
      not going to be forever thrown at people&rsquo;s heads to be married. I want&mdash;I
      want&mdash;well, I&rsquo;ll tell you, I wish to run away from home, and I have
      chosen you to help me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Run away from home?&rdquo; cried the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;yes! Run away from home!&rdquo; she repeated, in a
      transport of rage. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t, I won&rsquo;t be made to blush every minute by them
      all! I don&rsquo;t want to blush before Prince S. or Evgenie Pavlovitch, or
      anyone, and therefore I have chosen you. I shall tell you everything, <i>everything</i>,
      even the most important things of all, whenever I like, and you are to
      hide nothing from me on your side. I want to speak to at least one person,
      as I would to myself. They have suddenly begun to say that I am waiting
      for you, and in love with you. They began this before you arrived here,
      and so I didn&rsquo;t show them the letter, and now they all say it, every one
      of them. I want to be brave, and be afraid of nobody. I don&rsquo;t want to go
      to their balls and things&mdash;I want to do good. I have long desired to
      run away, for I have been kept shut up for twenty years, and they are
      always trying to marry me off. I wanted to run away when I was fourteen
      years old&mdash;I was a little fool then, I know&mdash;but now I have
      worked it all out, and I have waited for you to tell me about foreign
      countries. I have never seen a single Gothic cathedral. I must go to Rome;
      I must see all the museums; I must study in Paris. All this last year I
      have been preparing and reading forbidden books. Alexandra and Adelaida
      are allowed to read anything they like, but I mayn&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t want to
      quarrel with my sisters, but I told my parents long ago that I wish to
      change my social position. I have decided to take up teaching, and I count
      on you because you said you loved children. Can we go in for education
      together&mdash;if not at once, then afterwards? We could do good together.
      I won&rsquo;t be a general&rsquo;s daughter any more! Tell me, are you a very learned
      man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no; not at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh-h-h! I&rsquo;m sorry for that. I thought you were. I wonder why I always
      thought so&mdash;but at all events you&rsquo;ll help me, won&rsquo;t you? Because I&rsquo;ve
      chosen you, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aglaya Ivanovna, it&rsquo;s absurd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I will, I <i>will</i> run away!&rdquo; she cried&mdash;and her eyes flashed
      again with anger&mdash;&ldquo;and if you don&rsquo;t agree I shall go and marry
      Gavrila Ardalionovitch! I won&rsquo;t be considered a horrible girl, and accused
      of goodness knows what.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you out of your mind?&rdquo; cried the prince, almost starting from his
      seat. &ldquo;What do they accuse you of? Who accuses you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At home, everybody, mother, my sisters, Prince S., even that detestable
      Colia! If they don&rsquo;t say it, they think it. I told them all so to their
      faces. I told mother and father and everybody. Mamma was ill all the day
      after it, and next day father and Alexandra told me that I didn&rsquo;t
      understand what nonsense I was talking. I informed them that they little
      knew me&mdash;I was not a small child&mdash;I understood every word in the
      language&mdash;that I had read a couple of Paul de Kok&rsquo;s novels two years
      since on purpose, so as to know all about everything. No sooner did mamma
      hear me say this than she nearly fainted!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A strange thought passed through the prince&rsquo;s brain; he gazed intently at
      Aglaya and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not believe that this was the same haughty young girl who had
      once so proudly shown him Gania&rsquo;s letter. He could not understand how that
      proud and austere beauty could show herself to be such an utter child&mdash;a
      child who probably did not even now understand some words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you always lived at home, Aglaya Ivanovna?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I mean, have
      you never been to school, or college, or anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;never&mdash;nowhere! I&rsquo;ve been at home all my life, corked up in
      a bottle; and they expect me to be married straight out of it. What are
      you laughing at again? I observe that you, too, have taken to laughing at
      me, and range yourself on their side against me,&rdquo; she added, frowning
      angrily. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t irritate me&mdash;I&rsquo;m bad enough without that&mdash;I
      don&rsquo;t know what I am doing sometimes. I am persuaded that you came here
      today in the full belief that I am in love with you, and that I arranged
      this meeting because of that,&rdquo; she cried, with annoyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I admit I was afraid that that was the case, yesterday,&rdquo; blundered the
      prince (he was rather confused), &ldquo;but today I am quite convinced that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo; cried Aglaya&mdash;and her lower lip trembled violently. &ldquo;You were
      <i>afraid</i> that I&mdash;you dared to think that I&mdash;good gracious!
      you suspected, perhaps, that I sent for you to come here in order to catch
      you in a trap, so that they should find us here together, and make you
      marry me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aglaya Ivanovna, aren&rsquo;t you ashamed of saying such a thing? How could
      such a horrible idea enter your sweet, innocent heart? I am certain you
      don&rsquo;t believe a word of what you say, and probably you don&rsquo;t even know
      what you are talking about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aglaya sat with her eyes on the ground; she seemed to have alarmed even
      herself by what she had said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not; I&rsquo;m not a bit ashamed!&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;And how do you know
      my heart is innocent? And how dared you send me a love-letter that time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Love-letter?</i> My letter a love-letter? That letter was the most
      respectful of letters; it went straight from my heart, at what was perhaps
      the most painful moment of my life! I thought of you at the time as a kind
      of light. I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, very well, very well!&rdquo; she said, but quite in a different tone. She
      was remorseful now, and bent forward to touch his shoulder, though still
      trying not to look him in the face, as if the more persuasively to beg him
      not to be angry with her. &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; she continued, looking thoroughly
      ashamed of herself, &ldquo;I feel that I said a very foolish thing. I only did
      it just to try you. Take it as unsaid, and if I offended you, forgive me.
      Don&rsquo;t look straight at me like that, please; turn your head away. You
      called it a &lsquo;horrible idea&rsquo;; I only said it to shock you. Very often I am
      myself afraid of saying what I intend to say, and out it comes all the
      same. You have just told me that you wrote that letter at the most painful
      moment of your life. I know what moment that was!&rdquo; she added softly,
      looking at the ground again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, if you could know all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>do</i> know all!&rdquo; she cried, with another burst of indignation. &ldquo;You
      were living in the same house as that horrible woman with whom you ran
      away.&rdquo; She did not blush as she said this; on the contrary, she grew pale,
      and started from her seat, apparently oblivious of what she did, and
      immediately sat down again. Her lip continued to tremble for a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence for a moment. The prince was taken aback by the
      suddenness of this last reply, and did not know to what he should
      attribute it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t love you a bit!&rdquo; she said suddenly, just as though the words had
      exploded from her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince did not answer, and there was silence again. &ldquo;I love Gavrila
      Ardalionovitch,&rdquo; she said, quickly; but hardly audibly, and with her head
      bent lower than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is <i>not</i> true,&rdquo; said the prince, in an equally low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! I tell stories, do I? It is true! I gave him my promise a couple of
      days ago on this very seat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince was startled, and reflected for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not true,&rdquo; he repeated, decidedly; &ldquo;you have just invented it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are wonderfully polite. You know he is greatly improved. He loves me
      better than his life. He let his hand burn before my very eyes in order to
      prove to me that he loved me better than his life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He burned his hand!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, believe it or not! It&rsquo;s all the same to me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince sat silent once more. Aglaya did not seem to be joking; she was
      too angry for that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! he brought a candle with him to this place? That is, if the episode
      happened here; otherwise I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a candle! What&rsquo;s there improbable about that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A whole one, and in a candlestick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;no&mdash;half a candle&mdash;an end, you know&mdash;no, it was a
      whole candle; it&rsquo;s all the same. Be quiet, can&rsquo;t you! He brought a box of
      matches too, if you like, and then lighted the candle and held his finger
      in it for half an hour and more!&mdash;There! Can&rsquo;t that be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw him yesterday, and his fingers were all right!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aglaya suddenly burst out laughing, as simply as a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know why I have just told you these lies?&rdquo; She appealed to the
      prince, of a sudden, with the most childlike candour, and with the laugh
      still trembling on her lips. &ldquo;Because when one tells a lie, if one insists
      on something unusual and eccentric&mdash;something too &lsquo;out of the way&rsquo;
      for anything, you know&mdash;the more impossible the thing is, the more
      plausible does the lie sound. I&rsquo;ve noticed this. But I managed it badly; I
      didn&rsquo;t know how to work it.&rdquo; She suddenly frowned again at this point as
      though at some sudden unpleasant recollection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If&rdquo;&mdash;she began, looking seriously and even sadly at him&mdash;&ldquo;if
      when I read you all that about the &lsquo;poor knight,&rsquo; I wished to-to praise
      you for one thing&mdash;I also wished to show you that I knew all&mdash;and
      did not approve of your conduct.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very unfair to me, and to that unfortunate woman of whom you
      spoke just now in such dreadful terms, Aglaya.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I know all, all&mdash;and that is why I speak so. I know very
      well how you&mdash;half a year since&mdash;offered her your hand before
      everybody. Don&rsquo;t interrupt me. You see, I am merely stating facts without
      any comment upon them. After that she ran away with Rogojin. Then you
      lived with her at some village or town, and she ran away from you.&rdquo;
       (Aglaya blushed dreadfully.) &ldquo;Then she returned to Rogojin again, who
      loves her like a madman. Then you&mdash;like a wise man as you are&mdash;came
      back here after her as soon as ever you heard that she had returned to
      Petersburg. Yesterday evening you sprang forward to protect her, and just
      now you dreamed about her. You see, I know all. You did come back here for
      her, for her&mdash;now didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;for her!&rdquo; said the prince softly and sadly, and bending his
      head down, quite unconscious of the fact that Aglaya was gazing at him
      with eyes which burned like live coals. &ldquo;I came to find out something&mdash;I
      don&rsquo;t believe in her future happiness as Rogojin&rsquo;s wife, although&mdash;in
      a word, I did not know how to help her or what to do for her&mdash;but I
      came, on the chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at Aglaya, who was listening with a look of hatred on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you came without knowing why, I suppose you love her very much
      indeed!&rdquo; she said at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the prince, &ldquo;no, I do not love her. Oh! if you only knew with
      what horror I recall the time I spent with her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A shudder seemed to sweep over his whole body at the recollection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me about it,&rdquo; said Aglaya.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing which you might not hear. Why I should wish to tell you,
      and only you, this experience of mine, I really cannot say; perhaps it
      really is because I love you very much. This unhappy woman is persuaded
      that she is the most hopeless, fallen creature in the world. Oh, do not
      condemn her! Do not cast stones at her! She has suffered too much already
      in the consciousness of her own undeserved shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she is not guilty&mdash;oh God!&mdash;Every moment she bemoans and
      bewails herself, and cries out that she does not admit any guilt, that she
      is the victim of circumstances&mdash;the victim of a wicked libertine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But whatever she may say, remember that she does not believe it herself,&mdash;remember
      that she will believe nothing but that she is a guilty creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I tried to rid her soul of this gloomy fallacy, she suffered so
      terribly that my heart will never be quite at peace so long as I can
      remember that dreadful time!&mdash;Do you know why she left me? Simply to
      prove to me what is not true&mdash;that she is base. But the worst of it
      is, she did not realize herself that that was all she wanted to prove by
      her departure! She went away in response to some inner prompting to do
      something disgraceful, in order that she might say to herself&mdash;&lsquo;There&mdash;you&rsquo;ve
      done a new act of shame&mdash;you degraded creature!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Aglaya&mdash;perhaps you cannot understand all this. Try to realize
      that in the perpetual admission of guilt she probably finds some dreadful
      unnatural satisfaction&mdash;as though she were revenging herself upon
      someone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now and then I was able to persuade her almost to see light around her
      again; but she would soon fall, once more, into her old tormenting
      delusions, and would go so far as to reproach me for placing myself on a
      pedestal above her (I never had an idea of such a thing!), and informed
      me, in reply to my proposal of marriage, that she &lsquo;did not want
      condescending sympathy or help from anybody.&rsquo; You saw her last night. You
      don&rsquo;t suppose she can be happy among such people as those&mdash;you cannot
      suppose that such society is fit for her? You have no idea how
      well-educated she is, and what an intellect she has! She astonished me
      sometimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you preached her sermons there, did you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; continued the prince thoughtfully, not noticing Aglaya&rsquo;s mocking
      tone, &ldquo;I was almost always silent there. I often wished to speak, but I
      really did not know what to say. In some cases it is best to say nothing,
      I think. I loved her, yes, I loved her very much indeed; but afterwards&mdash;afterwards
      she guessed all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did she guess?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I only <i>pitied</i> her&mdash;and&mdash;and loved her no longer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know that? How do you know that she is not really in love with
      that&mdash;that rich cad&mdash;the man she eloped with?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no! I know she only laughs at him; she has made a fool of him all
      along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has she never laughed at you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;in anger, perhaps. Oh yes! she reproached me dreadfully in
      anger; and suffered herself, too! But afterwards&mdash;oh! don&rsquo;t remind me&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      remind me of that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hid his face in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you aware that she writes to me almost every day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that is true, is it?&rdquo; cried the prince, greatly agitated. &ldquo;I had heard
      a report of it, but would not believe it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom did you hear it from?&rdquo; asked Aglaya, alarmed. &ldquo;Rogojin said
      something about it yesterday, but nothing definite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yesterday! Morning or evening? Before the music or after?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After&mdash;it was about twelve o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Well, if it was Rogojin&mdash;but do you know what she writes to me
      about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should not be surprised by anything. She is mad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are the letters.&rdquo; (Aglaya took three letters out of her pocket and
      threw them down before the prince.) &ldquo;For a whole week she has been
      entreating and worrying and persuading me to marry you. She&mdash;well,
      she is clever, though she may be mad&mdash;much cleverer than I am, as you
      say. Well, she writes that she is in love with me herself, and tries to
      see me every day, if only from a distance. She writes that you love me,
      and that she has long known it and seen it, and that you and she talked
      about me&mdash;there. She wishes to see you happy, and she says that she
      is certain only I can ensure you the happiness you deserve. She writes
      such strange, wild letters&mdash;I haven&rsquo;t shown them to anyone. Now, do
      you know what all this means? Can you guess anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is madness&mdash;it is merely another proof of her insanity!&rdquo; said the
      prince, and his lips trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are crying, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Aglaya. No, I&rsquo;m not crying.&rdquo; The prince looked at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what am I to do? What do you advise me? I cannot go on receiving
      these letters, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, let her alone, I entreat you!&rdquo; cried the prince. &ldquo;What can you do in
      this dark, gloomy mystery? Let her alone, and I&rsquo;ll use all my power to
      prevent her writing you any more letters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If so, you are a heartless man!&rdquo; cried Aglaya. &ldquo;As if you can&rsquo;t see that
      it is not myself she loves, but you, you, and only you! Surely you have
      not remarked everything else in her, and only not <i>this?</i> Do you know
      what these letters mean? They mean jealousy, sir&mdash;nothing but pure
      jealousy! She&mdash;do you think she will ever really marry this Rogojin,
      as she says here she will? She would take her own life the day after you
      and I were married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince shuddered; his heart seemed to freeze within him. He gazed at
      Aglaya in wonderment; it was difficult for him to realize that this child
      was also a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God knows, Aglaya, that to restore her peace of mind and make her happy I
      would willingly give up my life. But I cannot love her, and she knows
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, make a sacrifice of yourself! That sort of thing becomes you well,
      you know. Why not do it? And don&rsquo;t call me &lsquo;Aglaya&rsquo;; you have done it
      several times lately. You are bound, it is your <i>duty</i> to &lsquo;raise&rsquo;
      her; you must go off somewhere again to soothe and pacify her. Why, you
      love her, you know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot sacrifice myself so, though I admit I did wish to do so once.
      Who knows, perhaps I still wish to! But I know for <i>certain</i>, that if
      she married me it would be her ruin; I know this and therefore I leave her
      alone. I ought to go to see her today; now I shall probably not go. She is
      proud, she would never forgive me the nature of the love I bear her, and
      we should both be ruined. This may be unnatural, I don&rsquo;t know; but
      everything seems unnatural. You say she loves me, as if this were <i>love!</i>
      As if she could love <i>me</i>, after what I have been through! No, no, it
      is not love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How pale you have grown!&rdquo; cried Aglaya in alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s nothing. I haven&rsquo;t slept, that&rsquo;s all, and I&rsquo;m rather tired. I&mdash;we
      certainly did talk about you, Aglaya.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, indeed, it is true then! <i>You could actually talk about me with her</i>;
      and&mdash;and how could you have been fond of me when you had only seen me
      once?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Perhaps it was that I seemed to come upon light in the
      midst of my gloom. I told you the truth when I said I did not know why I
      thought of you before all others. Of course it was all a sort of dream, a
      dream amidst the horrors of reality. Afterwards I began to work. I did not
      intend to come back here for two or three years&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you came for her sake?&rdquo; Aglaya&rsquo;s voice trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I came for her sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment or two of gloomy silence. Aglaya rose from her seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you say,&rdquo; she began in shaky tones, &ldquo;if you say that this woman of
      yours is mad&mdash;at all events I have nothing to do with her insane
      fancies. Kindly take these three letters, Lef Nicolaievitch, and throw
      them back to her, from me. And if she dares,&rdquo; cried Aglaya suddenly, much
      louder than before, &ldquo;if she dares so much as write me one word again, tell
      her I shall tell my father, and that she shall be taken to a lunatic
      asylum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince jumped up in alarm at Aglaya&rsquo;s sudden wrath, and a mist seemed
      to come before his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot really feel like that! You don&rsquo;t mean what you say. It is not
      true,&rdquo; he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It <i>is</i> true, it <i>is</i> true,&rdquo; cried Aglaya, almost beside
      herself with rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s true? What&rsquo;s all this? What&rsquo;s true?&rdquo; said an alarmed voice just
      beside them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before them stood Lizabetha Prokofievna.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s true that I am going to marry Gavrila Ardalionovitch, that I
      love him and intend to elope with him tomorrow,&rdquo; cried Aglaya, turning
      upon her mother. &ldquo;Do you hear? Is your curiosity satisfied? Are you
      pleased with what you have heard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aglaya rushed away homewards with these words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m! well, <i>you</i> are not going away just yet, my friend, at all
      events,&rdquo; said Lizabetha, stopping the prince. &ldquo;Kindly step home with me,
      and let me have a little explanation of the mystery. Nice goings on,
      these! I haven&rsquo;t slept a wink all night as it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince followed her.
    </p>
    <h3>
      IX.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Arrived at her house, Lizabetha Prokofievna paused in the first room. She
      could go no farther, and subsided on to a couch quite exhausted; too
      feeble to remember so much as to ask the prince to take a seat. This was a
      large reception-room, full of flowers, and with a glass door leading into
      the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alexandra and Adelaida came in almost immediately, and looked inquiringly
      at the prince and their mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girls generally rose at about nine in the morning in the country;
      Aglaya, of late, had been in the habit of getting up rather earlier and
      having a walk in the garden, but not at seven o&rsquo;clock; about eight or a
      little later was her usual time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lizabetha Prokofievna, who really had not slept all night, rose at about
      eight on purpose to meet Aglaya in the garden and walk with her; but she
      could not find her either in the garden or in her own room.
    </p>
    <p>
      This agitated the old lady considerably; and she awoke her other
      daughters. Next, she learned from the maid that Aglaya had gone into the
      park before seven o&rsquo;clock. The sisters made a joke of Aglaya&rsquo;s last freak,
      and told their mother that if she went into the park to look for her,
      Aglaya would probably be very angry with her, and that she was pretty sure
      to be sitting reading on the green bench that she had talked of two or
      three days since, and about which she had nearly quarrelled with Prince
      S., who did not see anything particularly lovely in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived at the rendezvous of the prince and her daughter, and hearing the
      strange words of the latter, Lizabetha Prokofievna had been dreadfully
      alarmed, for many reasons. However, now that she had dragged the prince
      home with her, she began to feel a little frightened at what she had
      undertaken. Why should not Aglaya meet the prince in the park and have a
      talk with him, even if such a meeting should be by appointment?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t suppose, prince,&rdquo; she began, bracing herself up for the effort,
      &ldquo;don&rsquo;t suppose that I have brought you here to ask questions. After last
      night, I assure you, I am not so exceedingly anxious to see you at all; I
      could have postponed the pleasure for a long while.&rdquo; She paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But at the same time you would be very glad to know how I happened to
      meet Aglaya Ivanovna this morning?&rdquo; The prince finished her speech for her
      with the utmost composure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what then? Supposing I should like to know?&rdquo; cried Lizabetha
      Prokofievna, blushing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I am not afraid of plain speaking. I&rsquo;m
      not offending anyone, and I never wish to, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, it is no offence to wish to know this; you are her mother. We
      met at the green bench this morning, punctually at seven o&rsquo;clock,&mdash;according
      to an agreement made by Aglaya Ivanovna with myself yesterday. She said
      that she wished to see me and speak to me about something important. We
      met and conversed for an hour about matters concerning Aglaya Ivanovna
      herself, and that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it is all, my friend. I don&rsquo;t doubt you for a moment,&rdquo; said
      Lizabetha Prokofievna with dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well done, prince, capital!&rdquo; cried Aglaya, who entered the room at this
      moment. &ldquo;Thank you for assuming that I would not demean myself with lies.
      Come, is that enough, mamma, or do you intend to put any more questions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know I have never needed to blush before you, up to this day, though
      perhaps you would have been glad enough to make me,&rdquo; said Lizabetha
      Prokofievna,&mdash;with majesty. &ldquo;Good-bye, prince; forgive me for
      bothering you. I trust you will rest assured of my unalterable esteem for
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince made his bows and retired at once. Alexandra and Adelaida
      smiled and whispered to each other, while Lizabetha Prokofievna glared
      severely at them. &ldquo;We are only laughing at the prince&rsquo;s beautiful bows,
      mamma,&rdquo; said Adelaida. &ldquo;Sometimes he bows just like a meal-sack, but
      to-day he was like&mdash;like Evgenie Pavlovitch!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the <i>heart</i> which is the best teacher of refinement and
      dignity, not the dancing-master,&rdquo; said her mother, sententiously, and
      departed upstairs to her own room, not so much as glancing at Aglaya.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the prince reached home, about nine o&rsquo;clock, he found Vera Lebedeff
      and the maid on the verandah. They were both busy trying to tidy up the
      place after last night&rsquo;s disorderly party.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank goodness, we&rsquo;ve just managed to finish it before you came in!&rdquo; said
      Vera, joyfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning! My head whirls so; I didn&rsquo;t sleep all night. I should like
      to have a nap now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, on the verandah? Very well, I&rsquo;ll tell them all not to come and wake
      you. Papa has gone out somewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The servant left the room. Vera was about to follow her, but returned and
      approached the prince with a preoccupied air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prince!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;have pity on that poor boy; don&rsquo;t turn him out
      today.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for the world; he shall do just as he likes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t do any harm now; and&mdash;and don&rsquo;t be too severe with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh dear no! Why&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&mdash;and you won&rsquo;t <i>laugh</i> at him? That&rsquo;s the chief thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no! Never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How foolish I am to speak of such things to a man like you,&rdquo; said Vera,
      blushing. &ldquo;Though you <i>do</i> look tired,&rdquo; she added, half turning away,
      &ldquo;your eyes are so splendid at this moment&mdash;so full of happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really?&rdquo; asked the prince, gleefully, and he laughed in delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Vera, simple-minded little girl that she was (just like a boy, in
      fact), here became dreadfully confused, of a sudden, and ran hastily out
      of the room, laughing and blushing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a dear little thing she is,&rdquo; thought the prince, and immediately
      forgot all about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked to the far end of the verandah, where the sofa stood, with a
      table in front of it. Here he sat down and covered his face with his
      hands, and so remained for ten minutes. Suddenly he put his hand in his
      coat-pocket and hurriedly produced three letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the door opened again, and out came Colia.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince actually felt glad that he had been interrupted,&mdash;and
      might return the letters to his pocket. He was glad of the respite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Colia, plunging <i>in medias res</i>, as he always did, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s a
      go! What do you think of Hippolyte now? Don&rsquo;t respect him any longer, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? But look here, Colia, I&rsquo;m tired; besides, the subject is too
      melancholy to begin upon again. How is he, though?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Asleep&mdash;he&rsquo;ll sleep for a couple of hours yet. I quite understand&mdash;you
      haven&rsquo;t slept&mdash;you walked about the park, I know. Agitation&mdash;excitement&mdash;all
      that sort of thing&mdash;quite natural, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know I walked in the park and didn&rsquo;t sleep at home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vera just told me. She tried to persuade me not to come, but I couldn&rsquo;t
      help myself, just for one minute. I have been having my turn at the
      bedside for the last two hours; Kostia Lebedeff is there now. Burdovsky
      has gone. Now, lie down, prince, make yourself comfortable, and sleep
      well! I&rsquo;m awfully impressed, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally, all this&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, I mean with the &lsquo;explanation,&rsquo; especially that part of it where
      he talks about Providence and a future life. There is a gigantic thought
      there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince gazed affectionately at Colia, who, of course, had come in
      solely for the purpose of talking about this &ldquo;gigantic thought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is not any one particular thought, only; it is the general
      circumstances of the case. If Voltaire had written this now, or Rousseau,
      I should have just read it and thought it remarkable, but should not have
      been so <i>impressed</i> by it. But a man who knows for certain that he
      has but ten minutes to live and can talk like that&mdash;why&mdash;it&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      <i>pride</i>, that is! It is really a most extraordinary, exalted
      assertion of personal dignity, it&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s <i>defiant!</i> What a <i>gigantic</i>
      strength of will, eh? And to accuse a fellow like that of not putting in
      the cap on purpose; it&rsquo;s base and mean! You know he deceived us last
      night, the cunning rascal. I never packed his bag for him, and I never saw
      his pistol. He packed it himself. But he put me off my guard like that,
      you see. Vera says you are going to let him stay on; I swear there&rsquo;s no
      danger, especially as we are always with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was by him at night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, and Burdovsky, and Kostia Lebedeff. Keller stayed a little while, and
      then went over to Lebedeff&rsquo;s to sleep. Ferdishenko slept at Lebedeff&rsquo;s,
      too; but he went away at seven o&rsquo;clock. My father is always at Lebedeff&rsquo;s;
      but he has gone out just now. I dare say Lebedeff will be coming in here
      directly; he has been looking for you; I don&rsquo;t know what he wants. Shall
      we let him in or not, if you are asleep? I&rsquo;m going to have a nap, too.
      By-the-by, such a curious thing happened. Burdovsky woke me at seven, and
      I met my father just outside the room, so drunk, he didn&rsquo;t even know me.
      He stood before me like a log, and when he recovered himself, asked
      hurriedly how Hippolyte was. &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he said, when I told him, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s all
      very well, but I <i>really</i> came to warn you that you must be very
      careful what you say before Ferdishenko.&rsquo; Do you follow me, prince?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Is it really so? However, it&rsquo;s all the same to us, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it is; we are not a secret society; and that being the case, it
      is all the more curious that the general should have been on his way to
      wake me up in order to tell me this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ferdishenko has gone, you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he went at seven o&rsquo;clock. He came into the room on his way out; I
      was watching just then. He said he was going to spend &lsquo;the rest of the
      night&rsquo; at Wilkin&rsquo;s; there&rsquo;s a tipsy fellow, a friend of his, of that name.
      Well, I&rsquo;m off. Oh, here&rsquo;s Lebedeff himself! The prince wants to go to
      sleep, Lukian Timofeyovitch, so you may just go away again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment, my dear prince, just one. I must absolutely speak to you
      about something which is most grave,&rdquo; said Lebedeff, mysteriously and
      solemnly, entering the room with a bow and looking extremely important. He
      had but just returned, and carried his hat in his hand. He looked
      preoccupied and most unusually dignified.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince begged him to take a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear you have called twice; I suppose you are still worried about
      yesterday&rsquo;s affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, about that boy, you mean? Oh dear no, yesterday my ideas were a
      little&mdash;well&mdash;mixed. Today, I assure you, I shall not oppose in
      the slightest degree any suggestions it may please you to make.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up with you this morning, Lebedeff? You look so important and
      dignified, and you choose your words so carefully,&rdquo; said the prince,
      smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nicolai Ardalionovitch!&rdquo; said Lebedeff, in a most amiable tone of voice,
      addressing the boy. &ldquo;As I have a communication to make to the prince which
      concerns only myself&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, of course, not my affair. All right,&rdquo; said Colia, and away he
      went.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love that boy for his perception,&rdquo; said Lebedeff, looking after him.
      &ldquo;My dear prince,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I have had a terrible misfortune, either
      last night or early this morning. I cannot tell the exact time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have lost four hundred roubles out of my side pocket! They&rsquo;re gone!&rdquo;
       said Lebedeff, with a sour smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve lost four hundred roubles? Oh! I&rsquo;m sorry for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is serious for a poor man who lives by his toil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, of course! How was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the wine is to blame, of course. I confess to you, prince, as I would
      to Providence itself. Yesterday I received four hundred roubles from a
      debtor at about five in the afternoon, and came down here by train. I had
      my purse in my pocket. When I changed, I put the money into the pocket of
      my plain clothes, intending to keep it by me, as I expected to have an
      applicant for it in the evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true then, Lebedeff, that you advertise to lend money on gold or
      silver articles?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, through an agent. My own name doesn&rsquo;t appear. I have a large family,
      you see, and at a small percentage&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so, quite so. I only asked for information&mdash;excuse the
      question. Go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, meanwhile that sick boy was brought here, and those guests came in,
      and we had tea, and&mdash;well, we made merry&mdash;to my ruin! Hearing of
      your birthday afterwards, and excited with the circumstances of the
      evening, I ran upstairs and changed my plain clothes once more for my
      uniform [Civil Service clerks in Russia wear uniform.]&mdash;you must have
      noticed I had my uniform on all the evening? Well, I forgot the money in
      the pocket of my old coat&mdash;you know when God will ruin a man he first
      of all bereaves him of his senses&mdash;and it was only this morning at
      half-past seven that I woke up and grabbed at my coat pocket, first thing.
      The pocket was empty&mdash;the purse gone, and not a trace to be found!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me! This is very unpleasant!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unpleasant! Indeed it is. You have found a very appropriate expression,&rdquo;
       said Lebedeff, politely, but with sarcasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what&rsquo;s to be done? It&rsquo;s a serious matter,&rdquo; said the prince,
      thoughtfully. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think you may have dropped it out of your pocket
      whilst intoxicated?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. Anything is possible when one is intoxicated, as you neatly
      express it, prince. But consider&mdash;if I, intoxicated or not, dropped
      an object out of my pocket on to the ground, that object ought to remain
      on the ground. Where is the object, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you put it away in some drawer, perhaps?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve looked everywhere, and turned out everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I confess this disturbs me a good deal. Someone must have picked it up,
      then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or taken it out of my pocket&mdash;two alternatives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very distressing, because <i>who</i>&mdash;? That&rsquo;s the question!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most undoubtedly, excellent prince, you have hit it&mdash;that is the
      very question. How wonderfully you express the exact situation in a few
      words!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, Lebedeff, no sarcasm! It&rsquo;s a serious&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sarcasm!&rdquo; cried Lebedeff, wringing his hands. &ldquo;All right, all right, I&rsquo;m
      not angry. I&rsquo;m only put out about this. Whom do you suspect?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a very difficult and complicated question. I cannot suspect the
      servant, for she was in the kitchen the whole evening, nor do I suspect
      any of my children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think not. Go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it must be one of the guests.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is such a thing possible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely and utterly impossible&mdash;and yet, so it must be. But one
      thing I am sure of, if it be a theft, it was committed, not in the evening
      when we were all together, but either at night or early in the morning;
      therefore, by one of those who slept here. Burdovsky and Colia I except,
      of course. They did not even come into my room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, or even if they had! But who did sleep with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four of us, including myself, in two rooms. The general, myself, Keller,
      and Ferdishenko. One of us four it must have been. I don&rsquo;t suspect myself,
      though such cases have been known.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! <i>do</i> go on, Lebedeff! Don&rsquo;t drag it out so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there are three left, then&mdash;Keller firstly. He is a drunkard
      to begin with, and a liberal (in the sense of other people&rsquo;s pockets),
      otherwise with more of the ancient knight about him than of the modern
      liberal. He was with the sick man at first, but came over afterwards
      because there was no place to lie down in the room and the floor was so
      hard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You suspect him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>did</i> suspect him. When I woke up at half-past seven and tore my
      hair in despair for my loss and carelessness, I awoke the general, who was
      sleeping the sleep of innocence near me. Taking into consideration the
      sudden disappearance of Ferdishenko, which was suspicious in itself, we
      decided to search Keller, who was lying there sleeping like a top. Well,
      we searched his clothes thoroughly, and not a farthing did we find; in
      fact, his pockets all had holes in them. We found a dirty handkerchief,
      and a love-letter from some scullery-maid. The general decided that he was
      innocent. We awoke him for further inquiries, and had the greatest
      difficulty in making him understand what was up. He opened his mouth and
      stared&mdash;he looked so stupid and so absurdly innocent. It wasn&rsquo;t
      Keller.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so glad!&rdquo; said the prince, joyfully. &ldquo;I was so afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afraid! Then you had some grounds for supposing he might be the culprit?&rdquo;
       said Lebedeff, frowning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no&mdash;not a bit! It was foolish of me to say I was afraid! Don&rsquo;t
      repeat it please, Lebedeff, don&rsquo;t tell anyone I said that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear prince! your words lie in the lowest depth of my heart&mdash;it
      is their tomb!&rdquo; said Lebedeff, solemnly, pressing his hat to the region of
      his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks; very well. Then I suppose it&rsquo;s Ferdishenko; that is, I mean, you
      suspect Ferdishenko?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom else?&rdquo; said Lebedeff, softly, gazing intently into the prince s
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course&mdash;quite so, whom else? But what are the proofs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have evidence. In the first place, his mysterious disappearance at
      seven o&rsquo;clock, or even earlier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, Colia told me that he had said he was off to&mdash;I forget the
      name, some friend of his, to finish the night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m! then Colia has spoken to you already?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not about the theft.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He does not know of it; I have kept it a secret. Very well, Ferdishenko
      went off to Wilkin&rsquo;s. That is not so curious in itself, but here the
      evidence opens out further. He left his address, you see, when he went.
      Now prince, consider, why did he leave his address? Why do you suppose he
      went out of his way to tell Colia that he had gone to Wilkin&rsquo;s? Who cared
      to know that he was going to Wilkin&rsquo;s? No, no! prince, this is finesse,
      thieves&rsquo; finesse! This is as good as saying, &lsquo;There, how can I be a thief
      when I leave my address? I&rsquo;m not concealing my movements as a thief
      would.&rsquo; Do you understand, prince?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, but that is not enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Second proof. The scent turns out to be false, and the address given is a
      sham. An hour after&mdash;that is at about eight, I went to Wilkin&rsquo;s
      myself, and there was no trace of Ferdishenko. The maid did tell me,
      certainly, that an hour or so since someone had been hammering at the
      door, and had smashed the bell; she said she would not open the door
      because she didn&rsquo;t want to wake her master; probably she was too lazy to
      get up herself. Such phenomena are met with occasionally!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But is that all your evidence? It is not enough!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, prince, whom are we to suspect, then? Consider!&rdquo; said Lebedeff with
      almost servile amiability, smiling at the prince. There was a look of
      cunning in his eyes, however.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should search your room and all the cupboards again,&rdquo; said the
      prince, after a moment or two of silent reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have done so, my dear prince!&rdquo; said Lebedeff, more sweetly than
      ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m! why must you needs go up and change your coat like that?&rdquo; asked the
      prince, banging the table with his fist, in annoyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t be so worried on my account, prince! I assure you I am not
      worth it! At least, not I alone. But I see you are suffering on behalf of
      the criminal too, for wretched Ferdishenko, in fact!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you have given me a disagreeable enough thing to think about,&rdquo;
       said the prince, irritably, &ldquo;but what are you going to do, since you are
      so sure it was Ferdishenko?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But who else <i>could</i> it be, my very dear prince?&rdquo; repeated Lebedeff,
      as sweet as sugar again. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t wish me to suspect Mr. Burdovsky?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor the general? Ha, ha, ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; said the prince, angrily, turning round upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so, nonsense! Ha, ha, ha! dear me! He did amuse me, did the
      general! We went off on the hot scent to Wilkin&rsquo;s together, you know; but
      I must first observe that the general was even more thunderstruck than I
      myself this morning, when I awoke him after discovering the theft; so much
      so that his very face changed&mdash;he grew red and then pale, and at
      length flew into a paroxysm of such noble wrath that I assure you I was
      quite surprised! He is a most generous-hearted man! He tells lies by the
      thousands, I know, but it is merely a weakness; he is a man of the highest
      feelings; a simple-minded man too, and a man who carries the conviction of
      innocence in his very appearance. I love that man, sir; I may have told
      you so before; it is a weakness of mine. Well&mdash;he suddenly stopped in
      the middle of the road, opened out his coat and bared his breast. &lsquo;Search
      me,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;you searched Keller; why don&rsquo;t you search me too? It is
      only fair!&rsquo; says he. And all the while his legs and hands were trembling
      with anger, and he as white as a sheet all over! So I said to him,
      &lsquo;Nonsense, general; if anybody but yourself had said that to me, I&rsquo;d have
      taken my head, my own head, and put it on a large dish and carried it
      round to anyone who suspected you; and I should have said: &ldquo;There, you see
      that head? It&rsquo;s my head, and I&rsquo;ll go bail with that head for him! Yes, and
      walk through the fire for him, too.&rdquo; There,&rsquo; says I,
      &lsquo;that&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;d answer
      for you, general!&rsquo; Then he embraced me, in the middle of the street, and
      hugged me so tight (crying over me all the while) that I coughed fit to
      choke! &lsquo;You are the one friend left to me amid all my misfortunes,&rsquo; says
      he. Oh, he&rsquo;s a man of sentiment, that! He went on to tell me a story of
      how he had been accused, or suspected, of stealing five hundred thousand
      roubles once, as a young man; and how, the very next day, he had rushed
      into a burning, blazing house and saved the very count who suspected him,
      and Nina Alexandrovna (who was then a young girl), from a fiery death. The
      count embraced him, and that was how he came to marry Nina Alexandrovna,
      he said. As for the money, it was found among the ruins next day in an
      English iron box with a secret lock; it had got under the floor somehow,
      and if it had not been for the fire it would never have been found! The
      whole thing is, of course, an absolute fabrication, though when he spoke
      of Nina Alexandrovna he wept! She&rsquo;s a grand woman, is Nina Alexandrovna,
      though she is very angry with me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you acquainted with her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, hardly at all. I wish I were, if only for the sake of justifying
      myself in her eyes. Nina Alexandrovna has a grudge against me for, as she
      thinks, encouraging her husband in drinking; whereas in reality I not only
      do not encourage him, but I actually keep him out of harm&rsquo;s way, and out
      of bad company. Besides, he&rsquo;s my friend, prince, so that I shall not lose
      sight of him, again. Where he goes, I go. He&rsquo;s quite given up visiting the
      captain&rsquo;s widow, though sometimes he thinks sadly of her, especially in
      the morning, when he&rsquo;s putting on his boots. I don&rsquo;t know why it&rsquo;s at that
      time. But he has no money, and it&rsquo;s no use his going to see her without.
      Has he borrowed any money from you, prince?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he has not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, he&rsquo;s ashamed to! He <i>meant</i> to ask you, I know, for he said so.
      I suppose he thinks that as you gave him some once (you remember), you
      would probably refuse if he asked you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you ever give him money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prince! Money! Why I would give that man not only my money, but my very
      life, if he wanted it. Well, perhaps that&rsquo;s exaggeration; not life, we&rsquo;ll
      say, but some illness, a boil or a bad cough, or anything of that sort, I
      would stand with pleasure, for his sake; for I consider him a great man
      fallen&mdash;money, indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m, then you <i>do</i> give him money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N-no, I have never given him money, and he knows well that I will never
      give him any; because I am anxious to keep him out of intemperate ways. He
      is going to town with me now; for you must know I am off to Petersburg
      after Ferdishenko, while the scent is hot; I&rsquo;m certain he is there. I
      shall let the general go one way, while I go the other; we have so
      arranged matters in order to pop out upon Ferdishenko, you see, from
      different sides. But I am going to follow that naughty old general and
      catch him, I know where, at a certain widow&rsquo;s house; for I think it will
      be a good lesson, to put him to shame by catching him with the widow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Lebedeff, don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t make any scandal about it!&rdquo; said the prince,
      much agitated, and speaking in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for the world, not for the world! I merely wish to make him ashamed
      of himself. Oh, prince, great though this misfortune be to myself, I
      cannot help thinking of his morals! I have a great favour to ask of you,
      esteemed prince; I confess that it is the chief object of my visit. You
      know the Ivolgins, you have even lived in their house; so if you would
      lend me your help, honoured prince, in the general&rsquo;s own interest and for
      his good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lebedeff clasped his hands in supplication.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What help do you want from me? You may be certain that I am most anxious
      to understand you, Lebedeff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I felt sure of that, or I should not have come to you. We might manage it
      with the help of Nina Alexandrovna, so that he might be closely watched in
      his own house. Unfortunately I am not on terms... otherwise... but Nicolai
      Ardalionovitch, who adores you with all his youthful soul, might help,
      too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! Heaven forbid that we should bring Nina Alexandrovna into this
      business! Or Colia, either. But perhaps I have not yet quite understood
      you, Lebedeff?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lebedeff made an impatient movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there is nothing to understand! Sympathy and tenderness, that is all&mdash;that
      is all our poor invalid requires! You will permit me to consider him an
      invalid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it shows delicacy and intelligence on your part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will explain my idea by a practical example, to make it clearer. You
      know the sort of man he is. At present his only failing is that he is
      crazy about that captain&rsquo;s widow, and he cannot go to her without money,
      and I mean to catch him at her house today&mdash;for his own good; but
      supposing it was not only the widow, but that he had committed a real
      crime, or at least some very dishonourable action (of which he is, of
      course, incapable), I repeat that even in that case, if he were treated
      with what I may call generous tenderness, one could get at the whole
      truth, for he is very soft-hearted! Believe me, he would betray himself
      before five days were out; he would burst into tears, and make a clean
      breast of the matter; especially if managed with tact, and if you and his
      family watched his every step, so to speak. Oh, my dear prince,&rdquo; Lebedeff
      added most emphatically, &ldquo;I do not positively assert that he has... I am
      ready, as the saying is, to shed my last drop of blood for him this
      instant; but you will admit that debauchery, drunkenness, and the
      captain&rsquo;s widow, all these together may lead him very far.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am, of course, quite ready to add my efforts to yours in such a case,&rdquo;
       said the prince, rising; &ldquo;but I confess, Lebedeff, that I am terribly
      perplexed. Tell me, do you still think... plainly, you say yourself that
      you suspect Mr. Ferdishenko?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lebedeff clasped his hands once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, who else could I possibly suspect? Who else, most outspoken prince?&rdquo;
       he replied, with an unctuous smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Muishkin frowned, and rose from his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, Lebedeff, a mistake here would be a dreadful thing. This
      Ferdishenko, I would not say a word against him, of course; but, who
      knows? Perhaps it really was he? I mean he really does seem to be a more
      likely man than... than any other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lebedeff strained his eyes and ears to take in what the prince was saying.
      The latter was frowning more and more, and walking excitedly up and down,
      trying not to look at Lebedeff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I was given to understand that Ferdishenko was that
      sort of man,&mdash;that one can&rsquo;t say everything before him. One has to
      take care not to say too much, you understand? I say this to prove that he
      really is, so to speak, more likely to have done this than anyone else,
      eh? You understand? The important thing is, not to make a mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who told you this about Ferdishenko?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I was told. Of course I don&rsquo;t altogether believe it. I am very sorry
      that I should have had to say this, because I assure you I don&rsquo;t believe
      it myself; it is all nonsense, of course. It was stupid of me to say
      anything about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, it is very important, it is most important to know where you got
      this report from,&rdquo; said Lebedeff, excitedly. He had risen from his seat,
      and was trying to keep step with the prince, running after him, up and
      down. &ldquo;Because look here, prince, I don&rsquo;t mind telling you now that as we
      were going along to Wilkin&rsquo;s this morning, after telling me what you know
      about the fire, and saving the count and all that, the general was pleased
      to drop certain hints to the same effect about Ferdishenko, but so vaguely
      and clumsily that I thought better to put a few questions to him on the
      matter, with the result that I found the whole thing was an invention of
      his excellency&rsquo;s own mind. Of course, he only lies with the best
      intentions; still, he lies. But, such being the case, where could you have
      heard the same report? It was the inspiration of the moment with him, you
      understand, so who could have told <i>you?</i> It is an important
      question, you see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was Colia told me, and his father told <i>him</i> at about six this
      morning. They met at the threshold, when Colia was leaving the room for
      something or other.&rdquo; The prince told Lebedeff all that Colia had made
      known to himself, in detail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There now, that&rsquo;s what we may call <i>scent!</i>&rdquo; said Lebedeff, rubbing
      his hands and laughing silently. &ldquo;I thought it must be so, you see. The
      general interrupted his innocent slumbers, at six o&rsquo;clock, in order to go
      and wake his beloved son, and warn him of the dreadful danger of
      companionship with Ferdishenko. Dear me! what a dreadfully dangerous man
      Ferdishenko must be, and what touching paternal solicitude, on the part of
      his excellency, ha! ha! ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, Lebedeff,&rdquo; began the prince, quite overwhelmed; &ldquo;<i>do</i> act
      quietly&mdash;don&rsquo;t make a scandal, Lebedeff, I ask you&mdash;I entreat
      you! No one must know&mdash;<i>no one</i>, mind! In that case only, I will
      help you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be assured, most honourable, most worthy of princes&mdash;be assured that
      the whole matter shall be buried within my heart!&rdquo; cried Lebedeff, in a
      paroxysm of exaltation. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d give every drop of my blood... Illustrious
      prince, I am a poor wretch in soul and spirit, but ask the veriest
      scoundrel whether he would prefer to deal with one like himself, or with a
      noble-hearted man like you, and there is no doubt as to his choice! He&rsquo;ll
      answer that he prefers the noble-hearted man&mdash;and there you have the
      triumph of virtue! <i>Au revoir</i>, honoured prince! You and I together&mdash;softly!
      softly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <h3>
      X.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The prince understood at last why he shivered with dread every time he
      thought of the three letters in his pocket, and why he had put off reading
      them until the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he fell into a heavy sleep on the sofa on the verandah, without
      having had the courage to open a single one of the three envelopes, he
      again dreamed a painful dream, and once more that poor, &ldquo;sinful&rdquo; woman
      appeared to him. Again she gazed at him with tears sparkling on her long
      lashes, and beckoned him after her; and again he awoke, as before, with
      the picture of her face haunting him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He longed to get up and go to her at once&mdash;but he <i>could not</i>.
      At length, almost in despair, he unfolded the letters, and began to read
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      These letters, too, were like a dream. We sometimes have strange,
      impossible dreams, contrary to all the laws of nature. When we awake we
      remember them and wonder at their strangeness. You remember, perhaps, that
      you were in full possession of your reason during this succession of
      fantastic images; even that you acted with extraordinary logic and cunning
      while surrounded by murderers who hid their intentions and made great
      demonstrations of friendship, while waiting for an opportunity to cut your
      throat. You remember how you escaped them by some ingenious stratagem;
      then you doubted if they were really deceived, or whether they were only
      pretending not to know your hiding-place; then you thought of another plan
      and hoodwinked them once again. You remember all this quite clearly, but
      how is it that your reason calmly accepted all the manifest absurdities
      and impossibilities that crowded into your dream? One of the murderers
      suddenly changed into a woman before your very eyes; then the woman was
      transformed into a hideous, cunning little dwarf; and you believed it, and
      accepted it all almost as a matter of course&mdash;while at the same time
      your intelligence seemed unusually keen, and accomplished miracles of
      cunning, sagacity, and logic! Why is it that when you awake to the world
      of realities you nearly always feel, sometimes very vividly, that the
      vanished dream has carried with it some enigma which you have failed to
      solve? You smile at the extravagance of your dream, and yet you feel that
      this tissue of absurdity contained some real idea, something that belongs
      to your true life,&mdash;something that exists, and has always existed, in
      your heart. You search your dream for some prophecy that you were
      expecting. It has left a deep impression upon you, joyful or cruel, but
      what it means, or what has been predicted to you in it, you can neither
      understand nor remember.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reading of these letters produced some such effect upon the prince. He
      felt, before he even opened the envelopes, that the very fact of their
      existence was like a nightmare. How could she ever have made up her mind
      to write to her? he asked himself. How could she write about that at all?
      And how could such a wild idea have entered her head? And yet, the
      strangest part of the matter was, that while he read the letters, he
      himself almost believed in the possibility, and even in the justification,
      of the idea he had thought so wild. Of course it was a mad dream, a
      nightmare, and yet there was something cruelly real about it. For hours he
      was haunted by what he had read. Several passages returned again and again
      to his mind, and as he brooded over them, he felt inclined to say to
      himself that he had foreseen and known all that was written here; it even
      seemed to him that he had read the whole of this some time or other, long,
      long ago; and all that had tormented and grieved him up to now was to be
      found in these old, long since read, letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you open this letter&rdquo; (so the first began), &ldquo;look first at the
      signature. The signature will tell you all, so that I need explain
      nothing, nor attempt to justify myself. Were I in any way on a footing
      with you, you might be offended at my audacity; but who am I, and who are
      you? We are at such extremes, and I am so far removed from you, that I
      could not offend you if I wished to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Farther on, in another place, she wrote: &ldquo;Do not consider my words as the
      sickly ecstasies of a diseased mind, but you are, in my opinion&mdash;perfection!
      I have seen you&mdash;I see you every day. I do not judge you; I have not
      weighed you in the scales of Reason and found you Perfection&mdash;it is
      simply an article of faith. But I must confess one sin against you&mdash;I
      love you. One should not love perfection. One should only look on it as
      perfection&mdash;yet I am in love with you. Though love equalizes, do not
      fear. I have not lowered you to my level, even in my most secret thoughts.
      I have written &lsquo;Do not fear,&rsquo; as if you could fear. I would kiss your
      footprints if I could; but, oh! I am not putting myself on a level with
      you!&mdash;Look at the signature&mdash;quick, look at the signature!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However, observe&rdquo; (she wrote in another of the letters), &ldquo;that although I
      couple you with him, yet I have not once asked you whether you love him.
      He fell in love with you, though he saw you but once. He spoke of you as
      of &lsquo;the light.&rsquo; These are his own words&mdash;I heard him use them. But I
      understood without his saying it that you were all that light is to him. I
      lived near him for a whole month, and I understood then that you, too,
      must love him. I think of you and him as one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was the matter yesterday?&rdquo; (she wrote on another sheet). &ldquo;I passed
      by you, and you seemed to me to <i>blush</i>. Perhaps it was only my
      fancy. If I were to bring you to the most loathsome den, and show you the
      revelation of undisguised vice&mdash;you should not blush. You can never
      feel the sense of personal affront. You may hate all who are mean, or
      base, or unworthy&mdash;but not for yourself&mdash;only for those whom
      they wrong. No one can wrong <i>you</i>. Do you know, I think you ought to
      love me&mdash;for you are the same in my eyes as in his&mdash;you are as light.
      An angel cannot hate, perhaps cannot love, either. I often ask myself&mdash;is
      it possible to love everybody? Indeed it is not; it is not in nature.
      Abstract love of humanity is nearly always love of self. But you are
      different. You cannot help loving all, since you can compare with none,
      and are above all personal offence or anger. Oh! how bitter it would be to
      me to know that you felt anger or shame on my account, for that would be
      your fall&mdash;you would become comparable at once with such as me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yesterday, after seeing you, I went home and thought out a picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Artists always draw the Saviour as an actor in one of the Gospel stories.
      I should do differently. I should represent Christ alone&mdash;the
      disciples did leave Him alone occasionally. I should paint one little
      child left with Him. This child has been playing about near Him, and had
      probably just been telling the Saviour something in its pretty baby
      prattle. Christ had listened to it, but was now musing&mdash;one hand
      reposing on the child&rsquo;s bright head. His eyes have a far-away expression.
      Thought, great as the Universe, is in them&mdash;His face is sad. The
      little one leans its elbow upon Christ&rsquo;s knee, and with its cheek resting
      on its hand, gazes up at Him, pondering as children sometimes do ponder.
      The sun is setting. There you have my picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are innocent&mdash;and in your innocence lies all your perfection&mdash;oh,
      remember that! What is my passion to you?&mdash;you are mine now; I shall
      be near you all my life&mdash;I shall not live long!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At length, in the last letter of all, he found:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t misunderstand me! Do not think that I humiliate
      myself by writing thus to you, or that I belong to that class of people
      who take a satisfaction in humiliating themselves&mdash;from pride. I have
      my consolation, though it would be difficult to explain it&mdash;but I do
      not humiliate myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do I wish to unite you two? For your sakes or my own? For my own
      sake, naturally. All the problems of my life would thus be solved; I have
      thought so for a long time. I know that once when your sister Adelaida saw
      my portrait she said that such beauty could overthrow the world. But I
      have renounced the world. You think it strange that I should say so, for
      you saw me decked with lace and diamonds, in the company of drunkards and
      wastrels. Take no notice of that; I know that I have almost ceased to
      exist. God knows what it is dwelling within me now&mdash;it is not myself.
      I can see it every day in two dreadful eyes which are always looking at
      me, even when not present. These eyes are silent now, they say nothing;
      but I know their secret. His house is gloomy, and there is a secret in it.
      I am convinced that in some box he has a razor hidden, tied round with
      silk, just like the one that Moscow murderer had. This man also lived with
      his mother, and had a razor hidden away, tied round with white silk, and
      with this razor he intended to cut a throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the while I was in their house I felt sure that somewhere beneath the
      floor there was hidden away some dreadful corpse, wrapped in oil-cloth,
      perhaps buried there by his father, who knows? Just as in the Moscow case.
      I could have shown you the very spot!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is always silent, but I know well that he loves me so much that he
      must hate me. My wedding and yours are to be on the same day; so I have
      arranged with him. I have no secrets from him. I would kill him from very
      fright, but he will kill me first. He has just burst out laughing, and
      says that I am raving. He knows I am writing to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was much more of this delirious wandering in the letters&mdash;one
      of them was very long.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the prince came out of the dark, gloomy park, in which he had
      wandered about for hours just as yesterday. The bright night seemed to him
      to be lighter than ever. &ldquo;It must be quite early,&rdquo; he thought. (He had
      forgotten his watch.) There was a sound of distant music somewhere. &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo;
       he thought, &ldquo;the Vauxhall! They won&rsquo;t be there today, of course!&rdquo; At this
      moment he noticed that he was close to their house; he had felt that he
      must gravitate to this spot eventually, and, with a beating heart, he
      mounted the verandah steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one met him; the verandah was empty, and nearly pitch dark. He opened
      the door into the room, but it, too, was dark and empty. He stood in the
      middle of the room in perplexity. Suddenly the door opened, and in came
      Alexandra, candle in hand. Seeing the prince she stopped before him in
      surprise, looking at him questioningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was clear that she had been merely passing through the room from door
      to door, and had not had the remotest notion that she would meet anyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you come here?&rdquo; she asked, at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;came in&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma is not very well, nor is Aglaya. Adelaida has gone to bed, and I am
      just going. We were alone the whole evening. Father and Prince S. have
      gone to town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come to you&mdash;now&mdash;to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what time it is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N&mdash;no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Half-past twelve. We are always in bed by one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I thought it was half-past nine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind!&rdquo; she laughed, &ldquo;but why didn&rsquo;t you come earlier? Perhaps you
      were expected!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought&rdquo; he stammered, making for the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Au revoir!</i> I shall amuse them all with this story tomorrow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He walked along the road towards his own house. His heart was beating, his
      thoughts were confused, everything around seemed to be part of a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly, just as twice already he had awaked from sleep with the same
      vision, that very apparition now seemed to rise up before him. The woman
      appeared to step out from the park, and stand in the path in front of him,
      as though she had been waiting for him there.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shuddered and stopped; she seized his hand and pressed it frenziedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, this was no apparition!
    </p>
    <p>
      There she stood at last, face to face with him, for the first time since
      their parting.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said something, but he looked silently back at her. His heart ached
      with anguish. Oh! never would he banish the recollection of this meeting
      with her, and he never remembered it but with the same pain and agony of
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went on her knees before him&mdash;there in the open road&mdash;like a
      madwoman. He retreated a step, but she caught his hand and kissed it, and,
      just as in his dream, the tears were sparkling on her long, beautiful
      lashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get up!&rdquo; he said, in a frightened whisper, raising her. &ldquo;Get up at once!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you happy&mdash;are you happy?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Say this one word. Are
      you happy now? Today, this moment? Have you just been with her? What did
      she say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not rise from her knees; she would not listen to him; she put her
      questions hurriedly, as though she were pursued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going away tomorrow, as you bade me&mdash;I won&rsquo;t write&mdash;so
      that this is the last time I shall see you, the last time! This is really
      the <i>last time!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, be calm&mdash;be calm! Get up!&rdquo; he entreated, in despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gazed thirstily at him and clutched his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye!&rdquo; she said at last, and rose and left him, very quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince noticed that Rogojin had suddenly appeared at her side, and had
      taken her arm and was leading her away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a minute, prince,&rdquo; shouted the latter, as he went. &ldquo;I shall be back
      in five minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He reappeared in five minutes as he had said. The prince was waiting for
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve put her in the carriage,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;it has been waiting round the
      corner there since ten o&rsquo;clock. She expected that you would be with <i>them</i>
      all the evening. I told her exactly what you wrote me. She won&rsquo;t write to
      the girl any more, she promises; and tomorrow she will be off, as you
      wish. She desired to see you for the last time, although you refused, so
      we&rsquo;ve been sitting and waiting on that bench till you should pass on your
      way home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she bring you with her of her own accord?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course she did!&rdquo; said Rogojin, showing his teeth; &ldquo;and I saw for
      myself what I knew before. You&rsquo;ve read her letters, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you read them?&rdquo; asked the prince, struck by the thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course&mdash;she showed them to me herself. You are thinking of the
      razor, eh? Ha, ha, ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, she is mad!&rdquo; cried the prince, wringing his hands.
      </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who knows?  Perhaps she is not so mad after all,&rdquo; said Rogojin, softly,
      as though thinking aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, good-bye,&rdquo; said Rogojin. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m off tomorrow too, you know. Remember
      me kindly! By-the-by,&rdquo; he added, turning round sharply again, &ldquo;did you
      answer her question just now? Are you happy, or not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, no!&rdquo; cried the prince, with unspeakable sadness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, ha! I never supposed you would say &lsquo;yes,&rsquo;&rdquo; cried Rogojin, laughing
      sardonically.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he disappeared, without looking round again.

    <h2>
      PART IV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I.
    </h3>
    <p>
      A week had elapsed since the rendezvous of our two friends on the green
      bench in the park, when, one fine morning at about half-past ten o&rsquo;clock,
      Varvara Ardalionovna, otherwise Mrs. Ptitsin, who had been out to visit a
      friend, returned home in a state of considerable mental depression.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are certain people of whom it is difficult to say anything which
      will at once throw them into relief&mdash;in other words, describe them
      graphically in their typical characteristics. These are they who are
      generally known as &ldquo;commonplace people,&rdquo; and this class comprises, of
      course, the immense majority of mankind. Authors, as a rule, attempt to
      select and portray types rarely met with in their entirety, but these
      types are nevertheless more real than real life itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Podkoleosin&rdquo; [A character in Gogol&rsquo;s comedy, The Wedding.] was perhaps an
      exaggeration, but he was by no means a non-existent character; on the
      contrary, how many intelligent people, after hearing of this Podkoleosin
      from Gogol, immediately began to find that scores of their friends were
      exactly like him! They knew, perhaps, before Gogol told them, that their
      friends were like Podkoleosin, but they did not know what name to give
      them. In real life, young fellows seldom jump out of the window just
      before their weddings, because such a feat, not to speak of its other
      aspects, must be a decidedly unpleasant mode of escape; and yet there are
      plenty of bridegrooms, intelligent fellows too, who would be ready to
      confess themselves Podkoleosins in the depths of their consciousness, just
      before marriage. Nor does every husband feel bound to repeat at every
      step, &ldquo;<i>Tu l&rsquo;as voulu, Georges Dandin!</i>&rdquo; like another typical
      personage; and yet how many millions and billions of Georges Dandins there
      are in real life who feel inclined to utter this soul-drawn cry after
      their honeymoon, if not the day after the wedding! Therefore, without
      entering into any more serious examination of the question, I will content
      myself with remarking that in real life typical characters are &ldquo;watered
      down,&rdquo; so to speak; and all these Dandins and Podkoleosins actually exist
      among us every day, but in a diluted form. I will just add, however, that
      Georges Dandin might have existed exactly as Molière presented him, and
      probably does exist now and then, though rarely; and so I will end this
      scientific examination, which is beginning to look like a newspaper
      criticism. But for all this, the question remains,&mdash;what are the
      novelists to do with commonplace people, and how are they to be presented
      to the reader in such a form as to be in the least degree interesting?
      They cannot be left out altogether, for commonplace people meet one at
      every turn of life, and to leave them out would be to destroy the whole
      reality and probability of the story. To fill a novel with typical
      characters only, or with merely strange and uncommon people, would render
      the book unreal and improbable, and would very likely destroy the
      interest. In my opinion, the duty of the novelist is to seek out points of
      interest and instruction even in the characters of commonplace people.
    </p>
    <p>
      For instance, when the whole essence of an ordinary person&rsquo;s nature lies
      in his perpetual and unchangeable commonplaceness; and when in spite of
      all his endeavours to do something out of the common, this person ends,
      eventually, by remaining in his unbroken line of routine&mdash;. I think
      such an individual really does become a type of his own&mdash;a type of
      commonplaceness which will not for the world, if it can help it, be
      contented, but strains and yearns to be something original and
      independent, without the slightest possibility of being so. To this class
      of commonplace people belong several characters in this novel;&mdash;characters
      which&mdash;I admit&mdash;I have not drawn very vividly up to now for my
      reader&rsquo;s benefit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such were, for instance, Varvara Ardalionovna Ptitsin, her husband, and
      her brother, Gania.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is nothing so annoying as to be fairly rich, of a fairly good
      family, pleasing presence, average education, to be &ldquo;not stupid,&rdquo;
       kind-hearted, and yet to have no talent at all, no originality, not a
      single idea of one&rsquo;s own&mdash;to be, in fact, &ldquo;just like everyone else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of such people there are countless numbers in this world&mdash;far more
      even than appear. They can be divided into two classes as all men can&mdash;that
      is, those of limited intellect, and those who are much cleverer. The
      former of these classes is the happier.
    </p>
    <p>
      To a commonplace man of limited intellect, for instance, nothing is
      simpler than to imagine himself an original character, and to revel in
      that belief without the slightest misgiving.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many of our young women have thought fit to cut their hair short, put on
      blue spectacles, and call themselves Nihilists. By doing this they have
      been able to persuade themselves, without further trouble, that they have
      acquired new convictions of their own. Some men have but felt some little
      qualm of kindness towards their fellow-men, and the fact has been quite
      enough to persuade them that they stand alone in the van of enlightenment
      and that no one has such humanitarian feelings as they. Others have but to
      read an idea of somebody else&rsquo;s, and they can immediately assimilate it
      and believe that it was a child of their own brain. The &ldquo;impudence of
      ignorance,&rdquo; if I may use the expression, is developed to a wonderful
      extent in such cases;&mdash;unlikely as it appears, it is met with at
      every turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      This confidence of a stupid man in his own talents has been wonderfully
      depicted by Gogol in the amazing character of Pirogoff. Pirogoff has not
      the slightest doubt of his own genius,&mdash;nay, of his <i>superiority</i>
      of genius,&mdash;so certain is he of it that he never questions it. How
      many Pirogoffs have there not been among our writers&mdash;scholars,
      propagandists? I say &ldquo;have been,&rdquo; but indeed there are plenty of them at
      this very day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our friend, Gania, belonged to the other class&mdash;to the &ldquo;much
      cleverer&rdquo; persons, though he was from head to foot permeated and saturated
      with the longing to be original. This class, as I have said above, is far
      less happy. For the &ldquo;clever commonplace&rdquo; person, though he may possibly
      imagine himself a man of genius and originality, none the less has within
      his heart the deathless worm of suspicion and doubt; and this doubt
      sometimes brings a clever man to despair. (As a rule, however, nothing
      tragic happens;&mdash;his liver becomes a little damaged in the course of
      time, nothing more serious. Such men do not give up their aspirations
      after originality without a severe struggle,&mdash;and there have been men
      who, though good fellows in themselves, and even benefactors to humanity,
      have sunk to the level of base criminals for the sake of originality).
    </p>
    <p>
      Gania was a beginner, as it were, upon this road. A deep and unchangeable
      consciousness of his own lack of talent, combined with a vast longing to
      be able to persuade himself that he was original, had rankled in his
      heart, even from childhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to have been born with overwrought nerves, and in his passionate
      desire to excel, he was often led to the brink of some rash step; and yet,
      having resolved upon such a step, when the moment arrived, he invariably
      proved too sensible to take it. He was ready, in the same way, to do a
      base action in order to obtain his wished-for object; and yet, when the
      moment came to do it, he found that he was too honest for any great
      baseness. (Not that he objected to acts of petty meanness&mdash;he was
      always ready for <i>them</i>.) He looked with hate and loathing on the
      poverty and downfall of his family, and treated his mother with haughty
      contempt, although he knew that his whole future depended on her character
      and reputation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aglaya had simply frightened him; yet he did not give up all thoughts of
      her&mdash;though he never seriously hoped that she would condescend to
      him. At the time of his &ldquo;adventure&rdquo; with Nastasia Philipovna he had come
      to the conclusion that money was his only hope&mdash;money should do all
      for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the moment when he lost Aglaya, and after the scene with Nastasia, he
      had felt so low in his own eyes that he actually brought the money back to
      the prince. Of this returning of the money given to him by a madwoman who
      had received it from a madman, he had often repented since&mdash;though he
      never ceased to be proud of his action. During the short time that
      Muishkin remained in Petersburg Gania had had time to come to hate him for
      his sympathy, though the prince told him that it was &ldquo;not everyone who
      would have acted so nobly&rdquo; as to return the money. He had long pondered,
      too, over his relations with Aglaya, and had persuaded himself that with
      such a strange, childish, innocent character as hers, things might have
      ended very differently. Remorse then seized him; he threw up his post, and
      buried himself in self-torment and reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lived at Ptitsin&rsquo;s, and openly showed contempt for the latter, though
      he always listened to his advice, and was sensible enough to ask for it
      when he wanted it. Gavrila Ardalionovitch was angry with Ptitsin because
      the latter did not care to become a Rothschild. &ldquo;If you are to be a Jew,&rdquo;
       he said, &ldquo;do it properly&mdash;squeeze people right and left, show some
      character; be the King of the Jews while you are about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ptitsin was quiet and not easily offended&mdash;he only laughed. But on
      one occasion he explained seriously to Gania that he was no Jew, that he
      did nothing dishonest, that he could not help the market price of money,
      that, thanks to his accurate habits, he had already a good footing and was
      respected, and that his business was flourishing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t ever be a Rothschild, and there is no reason why I should,&rdquo; he
      added, smiling; &ldquo;but I shall have a house in the Liteynaya, perhaps two,
      and that will be enough for me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Who knows but what I may have three!&rdquo; he
      concluded to himself; but this dream, cherished inwardly, he never
      confided to a soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nature loves and favours such people. Ptitsin will certainly have his
      reward, not three houses, but four, precisely because from childhood up he
      had realized that he would never be a Rothschild. That will be the limit
      of Ptitsin&rsquo;s fortune, and, come what may, he will never have more than
      four houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Varvara Ardalionovna was not like her brother. She too, had passionate
      desires, but they were persistent rather than impetuous. Her plans were as
      wise as her methods of carrying them out. No doubt she also belonged to
      the category of ordinary people who dream of being original, but she soon
      discovered that she had not a grain of true originality, and she did not
      let it trouble her too much. Perhaps a certain kind of pride came to her
      help. She made her first concession to the demands of practical life with
      great resolution when she consented to marry Ptitsin. However, when she
      married she did not say to herself, &ldquo;Never mind a mean action if it leads
      to the end in view,&rdquo; as her brother would certainly have said in such a
      case; it is quite probable that he may have said it when he expressed his
      elder-brotherly satisfaction at her decision. Far from this; Varvara
      Ardalionovna did not marry until she felt convinced that her future
      husband was unassuming, agreeable, almost cultured, and that nothing on
      earth would tempt him to a really dishonourable deed. As to small
      meannesses, such trifles did not trouble her. Indeed, who is free from
      them? It is absurd to expect the ideal! Besides, she knew that her
      marriage would provide a refuge for all her family. Seeing Gania unhappy,
      she was anxious to help him, in spite of their former disputes and
      misunderstandings. Ptitsin, in a friendly way, would press his
      brother-in-law to enter the army. &ldquo;You know,&rdquo; he said sometimes, jokingly,
      &ldquo;you despise generals and generaldom, but you will see that &lsquo;they&rsquo; will
      all end by being generals in their turn. You will see it if you live long
      enough!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why should they suppose that I despise generals?&rdquo; Gania thought
      sarcastically to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      To serve her brother&rsquo;s interests, Varvara Ardalionovna was constantly at
      the Epanchins&rsquo; house, helped by the fact that in childhood she and Gania
      had played with General Ivan Fedorovitch&rsquo;s daughters. It would have been
      inconsistent with her character if in these visits she had been pursuing a
      chimera; her project was not chimerical at all; she was building on a firm
      basis&mdash;on her knowledge of the character of the Epanchin family,
      especially Aglaya, whom she studied closely. All Varvara&rsquo;s efforts were
      directed towards bringing Aglaya and Gania together. Perhaps she achieved
      some result; perhaps, also, she made the mistake of depending too much
      upon her brother, and expecting more from him than he would ever be
      capable of giving. However this may be, her manoeuvres were skilful
      enough. For weeks at a time she would never mention Gania. Her attitude
      was modest but dignified, and she was always extremely truthful and
      sincere. Examining the depths of her conscience, she found nothing to
      reproach herself with, and this still further strengthened her in her
      designs. But Varvara Ardalionovna sometimes remarked that she felt
      spiteful; that there was a good deal of vanity in her, perhaps even of
      wounded vanity. She noticed this at certain times more than at others, and
      especially after her visits to the Epanchins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, as I have said, she returned from their house with a heavy feeling
      of dejection. There was a sensation of bitterness, a sort of mocking
      contempt, mingled with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived at her own house, Varia heard a considerable commotion going on in
      the upper storey, and distinguished the voices of her father and brother.
      On entering the salon she found Gania pacing up and down at frantic speed,
      pale with rage and almost tearing his hair. She frowned, and subsided on
      to the sofa with a tired air, and without taking the trouble to remove her
      hat. She very well knew that if she kept quiet and asked her brother
      nothing about his reason for tearing up and down the room, his wrath would
      fall upon her head. So she hastened to put the question:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old story, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old story? No! Heaven knows what&rsquo;s up now&mdash;I don&rsquo;t! Father has
      simply gone mad; mother&rsquo;s in floods of tears. Upon my word, Varia, I must
      kick him out of the house; or else go myself,&rdquo; he added, probably
      remembering that he could not well turn people out of a house which was
      not his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must make allowances,&rdquo; murmured Varia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make allowances? For whom? Him&mdash;the old blackguard? No, no, Varia&mdash;that
      won&rsquo;t do! It won&rsquo;t do, I tell you! And look at the swagger of the man!
      He&rsquo;s all to blame himself, and yet he puts on so much &lsquo;side&rsquo; that you&rsquo;d
      think&mdash;my word!&mdash;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s too much trouble to go through the gate,
      you must break the fence for me!&rsquo; That&rsquo;s the sort of air he puts on; but
      what&rsquo;s the matter with you, Varia? What a curious expression you have!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right,&rdquo; said Varia, in a tone that sounded as though she were all
      wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gania looked more intently at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been <i>there?</i>&rdquo; he asked, suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you find out anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing unexpected. I discovered that it&rsquo;s all true. My husband was wiser
      than either of us. Just as he suspected from the beginning, so it has
      fallen out. Where is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out. Well&mdash;what has happened?&mdash;go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The prince is formally engaged to her&mdash;that&rsquo;s settled. The elder
      sisters told me about it. Aglaya has agreed. They don&rsquo;t attempt to conceal
      it any longer; you know how mysterious and secret they have all been up to
      now. Adelaida&rsquo;s wedding is put off again, so that both can be married on
      one day. Isn&rsquo;t that delightfully romantic? Somebody ought to write a poem
      on it. Sit down and write an ode instead of tearing up and down like that.
      This evening Princess Bielokonski is to arrive; she comes just in time&mdash;they
      have a party tonight. He is to be presented to old Bielokonski, though I
      believe he knows her already; probably the engagement will be openly
      announced. They are only afraid that he may knock something down, or trip
      over something when he comes into the room. It would be just like him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gania listened attentively, but to his sister&rsquo;s astonishment he was by no
      means so impressed by this news (which should, she thought, have been so
      important to him) as she had expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it was clear enough all along,&rdquo; he said, after a moment&rsquo;s
      reflection. &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the end,&rdquo; he added, with a disagreeable smile,
      continuing to walk up and down the room, but much slower than before, and
      glancing slyly into his sister&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good thing that you take it philosophically, at all events,&rdquo; said
      Varia. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really very glad of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s off our hands&mdash;off <i>yours</i>, I should say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I have served you faithfully. I never even asked you what
      happiness you expected to find with Aglaya.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I ever expect to find happiness with Aglaya?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, don&rsquo;t overdo your philosophy. Of course you did. Now it&rsquo;s all
      over, and a good thing, too; pair of fools that we have been! I confess I
      have never been able to look at it seriously. I busied myself in it for
      your sake, thinking that there was no knowing what might happen with a
      funny girl like that to deal with. There were ninety to one chances
      against it. To this moment I can&rsquo;t make out why you wished for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m! now, I suppose, you and your husband will never weary of egging me
      on to work again. You&rsquo;ll begin your lectures about perseverance and
      strength of will, and all that. I know it all by heart,&rdquo; said Gania,
      laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got some new idea in his head,&rdquo; thought Varia. &ldquo;Are they pleased
      over there&mdash;the parents?&rdquo; asked Gania, suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N-no, I don&rsquo;t think they are. You can judge for yourself. I think
      the general is pleased enough; her mother is a little uneasy. She always
      loathed the idea of the prince as a <i>husband</i>; everybody knows that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, naturally. The bridegroom is an impossible and ridiculous one.
      I mean, has <i>she</i> given her formal consent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has not said &lsquo;no,&rsquo; up to now, and that&rsquo;s all. It was sure to be so
      with her. You know what she is like. You know how absurdly shy she is. You
      remember how she used to hide in a cupboard as a child, so as to avoid
      seeing visitors, for hours at a time. She is just the same now; but, do
      you know, I think there is something serious in the matter, even from her
      side; I feel it, somehow. She laughs at the prince, they say, from morn to
      night in order to hide her real feelings; but you may be sure she finds
      occasion to say something or other to him on the sly, for he himself is in
      a state of radiant happiness. He walks in the clouds; they say he is
      extremely funny just now; I heard it from themselves. They seemed to be
      laughing at me in their sleeves&mdash;those elder girls&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know
      why.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gania had begun to frown, and probably Varia added this last sentence in
      order to probe his thought. However, at this moment, the noise began again
      upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll turn him out!&rdquo; shouted Gania, glad of the opportunity of venting his
      vexation. &ldquo;I shall just turn him out&mdash;we can&rsquo;t have this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and then he&rsquo;ll go about the place and disgrace us as he did
      yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How &lsquo;as he did yesterday&rsquo;? What do you mean? What did he do yesterday?&rdquo;
       asked Gania, in alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, goodness me, don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo; Varia stopped short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? You don&rsquo;t mean to say that he went there yesterday!&rdquo; cried Gania,
      flushing red with shame and anger. &ldquo;Good heavens, Varia! Speak! You have
      just been there. <i>Was</i> he there or not, <i>quick?</i>&rdquo; And Gania
      rushed for the door. Varia followed and caught him by both hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing? Where are you going to? You can&rsquo;t let him go now; if
      you do he&rsquo;ll go and do something worse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he do there? What did he say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They couldn&rsquo;t tell me
      themselves; they couldn&rsquo;t make head or tail of it; but he frightened them
      all. He came to see the general, who was not at home; so he asked for
      Lizabetha Prokofievna. First of all, he begged her for some place, or
      situation, for work of some kind, and then he began to complain about <i>us</i>,
      about me and my husband, and you, especially <i>you</i>; he said a lot of
      things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! couldn&rsquo;t you find out?&rdquo; muttered Gania, trembling hysterically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;nothing more than that. Why, they couldn&rsquo;t understand him
      themselves; and very likely didn&rsquo;t tell me all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gania seized his head with both hands and tottered to the window; Varia
      sat down at the other window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Funny girl, Aglaya,&rdquo; she observed, after a pause. &ldquo;When she left me she
      said, &lsquo;Give my special and personal respects to your parents; I shall
      certainly find an opportunity to see your father one day,&rsquo; and so serious
      over it. She&rsquo;s a strange creature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t she joking? She was speaking sarcastically!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit of it;
      that&rsquo;s just the strange part of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does she know about father, do you think&mdash;or not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That they do <i>not</i> know about it in the house is quite certain, the
      rest of them, I mean; but you have given me an idea. Aglaya perhaps knows.
      She alone, though, if anyone; for the sisters were as astonished as I was
      to hear her speak so seriously. If she knows, the prince must have told
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! it&rsquo;s not a great matter to guess who told her. A thief! A thief in
      our family, and the head of the family, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! nonsense!&rdquo; cried Varia, angrily. &ldquo;That was nothing but a drunkard&rsquo;s
      tale. Nonsense! Why, who invented the whole thing&mdash;Lebedeff and the
      prince&mdash;a pretty pair! Both were probably drunk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father is a drunkard and a thief; I am a beggar, and the husband of my
      sister is a usurer,&rdquo; continued Gania, bitterly. &ldquo;There was a pretty list
      of advantages with which to enchant the heart of Aglaya.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That same husband of your sister, the usurer&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Feeds me? Go on. Don&rsquo;t stand on ceremony, pray.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lose your temper. You are just like a schoolboy. You think that all
      this sort of thing would harm you in Aglaya&rsquo;s eyes, do you? You little
      know her character. She is capable of refusing the most brilliant party,
      and running away and starving in a garret with some wretched student;
      that&rsquo;s the sort of girl she is. You never could or did understand how
      interesting you would have seen in her eyes if you had come firmly and
      proudly through our misfortunes. The prince has simply caught her with
      hook and line; firstly, because he never thought of fishing for her, and
      secondly, because he is an idiot in the eyes of most people. It&rsquo;s quite
      enough for her that by accepting him she puts her family out and annoys
      them all round&mdash;that&rsquo;s what she likes. You don&rsquo;t understand these
      things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall see whether I understand or no!&rdquo; said Gania, enigmatically. &ldquo;But
      I shouldn&rsquo;t like her to know all about father, all the same. I thought the
      prince would manage to hold his tongue about this, at least. He prevented
      Lebedeff spreading the news&mdash;he wouldn&rsquo;t even tell me all when I
      asked him&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you must see that he is not responsible. What does it matter to you
      now, in any case? What are you hoping for still? If you <i>have</i> a hope
      left, it is that your suffering air may soften her heart towards you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, she would funk a scandal like anyone else. You are all tarred with
      one brush!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! <i>Aglaya</i> would have funked? You are a chicken-hearted fellow,
      Gania!&rdquo; said Varia, looking at her brother with contempt. &ldquo;Not one of us
      is worth much. Aglaya may be a wild sort of a girl, but she is far nobler
      than any of us, a thousand times nobler!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;come! there&rsquo;s nothing to get cross about,&rdquo; said Gania.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All I&rsquo;m afraid of is&mdash;mother. I&rsquo;m afraid this scandal about father
      may come to her ears; perhaps it has already. I am dreadfully afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It undoubtedly has already!&rdquo; observed Gania.
    </p>
    <p>
      Varia had risen from her place and had started to go upstairs to her
      mother; but at this observation of Gania&rsquo;s she turned and gazed at him
      attentively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who could have told her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hippolyte, probably. He would think it the most delightful amusement in
      the world to tell her of it the instant he moved over here; I haven&rsquo;t a
      doubt of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how could he know anything of it? Tell me that. Lebedeff and the
      prince determined to tell no one&mdash;even Colia knows nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, Hippolyte? He found it out himself, of course. Why, you have no
      idea what a cunning little animal he is; dirty little gossip! He has the
      most extraordinary nose for smelling out other people&rsquo;s secrets, or
      anything approaching to scandal. Believe it or not, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure he
      has got round Aglaya. If he hasn&rsquo;t, he soon will. Rogojin is intimate with
      him, too. How the prince doesn&rsquo;t notice it, I can&rsquo;t understand. The little
      wretch considers me his enemy now and does his best to catch me tripping.
      What on earth does it matter to him, when he&rsquo;s dying? However, you&rsquo;ll see;
      I shall catch <i>him</i> tripping yet, and not he me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you get him over here, if you hate him so? And is it really worth
      your while to try to score off him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it was yourself who advised me to bring him over!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought he might be useful. You know he is in love with Aglaya himself,
      now, and has written to her; he has even written to Lizabetha
      Prokofievna!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! he&rsquo;s not dangerous there!&rdquo; cried Gania, laughing angrily. &ldquo;However, I
      believe there is something of that sort in the air; he is very likely to
      be in love, for he is a mere boy. But he won&rsquo;t write anonymous letters to
      the old lady; that would be too audacious a thing for him to attempt; but
      I dare swear the very first thing he did was to show me up to Aglaya as a
      base deceiver and intriguer. I confess I was fool enough to attempt
      something through him at first. I thought he would throw himself into my
      service out of revengeful feelings towards the prince, the sly little
      beast! But I know him better now. As for the theft, he may have heard of
      it from the widow in Petersburg, for if the old man committed himself to
      such an act, he can have done it for no other object but to give the money
      to her. Hippolyte said to me, without any prelude, that the general had
      promised the widow four hundred roubles. Of course I understood, and the
      little wretch looked at me with a nasty sort of satisfaction. I know him;
      you may depend upon it he went and told mother too, for the pleasure of
      wounding her. And why doesn&rsquo;t he die, I should like to know? He undertook
      to die within three weeks, and here he is getting fatter. His cough is
      better, too. It was only yesterday that he said that was the second day he
      hadn&rsquo;t coughed blood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, turn him out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t <i>hate</i>, I despise him,&rdquo; said Gania, grandly. &ldquo;Well, I do
      hate him, if you like!&rdquo; he added, with a sudden access of rage, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll
      tell him so to his face, even when he&rsquo;s dying! If you had but read his
      confession&mdash;good Lord! what refinement of impudence! Oh, but I&rsquo;d have
      liked to whip him then and there, like a schoolboy, just to see how
      surprised he would have been! Now he hates everybody because he&mdash;Oh,
      I say, what on earth are they doing there! Listen to that noise! I really
      can&rsquo;t stand this any longer. Ptitsin!&rdquo; he cried, as the latter entered the
      room, &ldquo;what in the name of goodness are we coming to? Listen to that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the noise came rapidly nearer, the door burst open, and old General
      Ivolgin, raging, furious, purple-faced, and trembling with anger, rushed
      in. He was followed by Nina Alexandrovna, Colia, and behind the rest,
      Hippolyte.
    </p>
    <h3>
      II.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Hippolyte had now been five days at the Ptitsins&rsquo;. His flitting from the
      prince&rsquo;s to these new quarters had been brought about quite naturally and
      without many words. He did not quarrel with the prince&mdash;in fact, they
      seemed to part as friends. Gania, who had been hostile enough on that
      eventful evening, had himself come to see him a couple of days later,
      probably in obedience to some sudden impulse. For some reason or other,
      Rogojin too had begun to visit the sick boy. The prince thought it might
      be better for him to move away from his (the prince&rsquo;s) house. Hippolyte
      informed him, as he took his leave, that Ptitsin &ldquo;had been kind enough to
      offer him a corner,&rdquo; and did not say a word about Gania, though Gania had
      procured his invitation, and himself came to fetch him away. Gania noticed
      this at the time, and put it to Hippolyte&rsquo;s debit on account.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gania was right when he told his sister that Hippolyte was getting better;
      that he was better was clear at the first glance. He entered the room now
      last of all, deliberately, and with a disagreeable smile on his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nina Alexandrovna came in, looking frightened. She had changed much since
      we last saw her, half a year ago, and had grown thin and pale. Colia
      looked worried and perplexed. He could not understand the vagaries of the
      general, and knew nothing of the last achievement of that worthy, which
      had caused so much commotion in the house. But he could see that his
      father had of late changed very much, and that he had begun to behave in
      so extraordinary a fashion both at home and abroad that he was not like
      the same man. What perplexed and disturbed him as much as anything was
      that his father had entirely given up drinking during the last few days.
      Colia knew that he had quarrelled with both Lebedeff and the prince, and
      had just bought a small bottle of vodka and brought it home for his
      father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, mother,&rdquo; he had assured Nina Alexandrovna upstairs, &ldquo;really you
      had better let him drink. He has not had a drop for three days; he must be
      suffering agonies&mdash;&rdquo; The general now entered the room, threw the door
      wide open, and stood on the threshold trembling with indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, my dear sir,&rdquo; he began, addressing Ptitsin in a very loud tone
      of voice; &ldquo;if you have really made up your mind to sacrifice an old man&mdash;your
      father too or at all events father of your wife&mdash;an old man who has
      served his emperor&mdash;to a wretched little atheist like this, all I can
      say is, sir, my foot shall cease to tread your floors. Make your choice,
      sir; make your choice quickly, if you please! Me or this&mdash;screw! Yes,
      screw, sir; I said it accidentally, but let the word stand&mdash;this
      screw, for he screws and drills himself into my soul&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t you better say corkscrew?&rdquo; said Hippolyte.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, <i>not</i> corkscrew. I am a general, not a bottle, sir. Make
      your choice, sir&mdash;me or him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Colia handed him a chair, and he subsided into it, breathless with
      rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t you better&mdash;better&mdash;take a nap?&rdquo; murmured the stupefied
      Ptitsin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A nap?&rdquo; shrieked the general. &ldquo;I am not drunk, sir; you insult me! I
      see,&rdquo; he continued, rising, &ldquo;I see that all are against me here. Enough&mdash;I
      go; but know, sirs&mdash;know that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was not allowed to finish his sentence. Somebody pushed him back into
      his chair, and begged him to be calm. Nina Alexandrovna trembled, and
      cried quietly. Gania retired to the window in disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what have I done? What is his grievance?&rdquo; asked Hippolyte, grinning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you done, indeed?&rdquo; put in Nina Alexandrovna. &ldquo;You ought to be
      ashamed of yourself, teasing an old man like that&mdash;and in your
      position, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And pray what <i>is</i> my position, madame? I have the greatest respect
      for you, personally; but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a little screw,&rdquo; cried the general; &ldquo;he drills holes in my heart and
      soul. He wishes me to be a pervert to atheism. Know, you young greenhorn,
      that I was covered with honours before ever you were born; and you are
      nothing better than a wretched little worm, torn in two with coughing, and
      dying slowly of your own malice and unbelief. What did Gavrila bring you
      over here for? They&rsquo;re all against me, even to my own son&mdash;all
      against me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come&mdash;nonsense!&rdquo; cried Gania; &ldquo;if you did not go shaming us all
      over the town, things might be better for all parties.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&mdash;shame you? I?&mdash;what do you mean, you young calf? I shame
      you? I can only do you honour, sir; I cannot shame you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He jumped up from his chair in a fit of uncontrollable rage. Gania was
      very angry too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honour, indeed!&rdquo; said the latter, with contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say, sir?&rdquo; growled the general, taking a step towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say that I have but to open my mouth, and you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gania began, but did not finish. The two&mdash;father and son&mdash;stood
      before one another, both unspeakably agitated, especially Gania.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gania, Gania, reflect!&rdquo; cried his mother, hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all nonsense on both sides,&rdquo; snapped out Varia. &ldquo;Let them alone,
      mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only for mother&rsquo;s sake that I spare him,&rdquo; said Gania, tragically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak!&rdquo; said the general, beside himself with rage and excitement; &ldquo;speak&mdash;under
      the penalty of a father&rsquo;s curse!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, father&rsquo;s curse be hanged&mdash;you don&rsquo;t frighten me that way!&rdquo; said
      Gania. &ldquo;Whose fault is it that you have been as mad as a March hare all
      this week? It is just a week&mdash;you see, I count the days. Take care
      now; don&rsquo;t provoke me too much, or I&rsquo;ll tell all. Why did you go to the
      Epanchins&rsquo; yesterday&mdash;tell me that? And you call yourself an old man,
      too, with grey hair, and father of a family! H&rsquo;m&mdash;nice sort of a
      father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be quiet, Gania,&rdquo; cried Colia. &ldquo;Shut up, you fool!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but how have I offended him?&rdquo; repeated Hippolyte, still in the same
      jeering voice. &ldquo;Why does he call me a screw? You all heard it. He came to
      me himself and began telling me about some Captain Eropegoff. I don&rsquo;t wish
      for your company, general. I always avoided you&mdash;you know that. What
      have I to do with Captain Eropegoff? All I did was to express my opinion
      that probably Captain Eropegoff never existed at all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course he never existed!&rdquo; Gania interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the general only stood stupefied and gazed around in a dazed way.
      Gania&rsquo;s speech had impressed him, with its terrible candour. For the first
      moment or two he could find no words to answer him, and it was only when
      Hippolyte burst out laughing, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, you see! Even your own son supports my statement that there never
      was such a person as Captain Eropegoff!&rdquo; that the old fellow muttered
      confusedly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kapiton Eropegoff&mdash;not Captain Eropegoff!&mdash;Kapiton&mdash;major
      retired&mdash;Eropegoff&mdash;Kapiton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kapiton didn&rsquo;t exist either!&rdquo; persisted Gania, maliciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Didn&rsquo;t exist?&rdquo; cried the poor general, and a deep blush suffused
      his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do, Gania!&rdquo; cried Varia and Ptitsin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut up, Gania!&rdquo; said Colia.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this intercession seemed to rekindle the general.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you mean, sir, that he didn&rsquo;t exist? Explain yourself,&rdquo; he
      repeated, angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he <i>didn&rsquo;t</i> exist&mdash;never could and never did&mdash;there!
      You&rsquo;d better drop the subject, I warn you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this is my son&mdash;my own son&mdash;whom I&mdash;oh, gracious
      Heaven! Eropegoff&mdash;Eroshka Eropegoff didn&rsquo;t exist!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, ha! it&rsquo;s Eroshka now,&rdquo; laughed Hippolyte.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, Kapitoshka&mdash;not Eroshka. I mean, Kapiton Alexeyevitch&mdash;retired
      major&mdash;married Maria Petrovna Lu&mdash;Lu&mdash;he was my friend and
      companion&mdash;Lutugoff&mdash;from our earliest beginnings. I closed his
      eyes for him&mdash;he was killed. Kapiton Eropegoff never existed! tfu!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The general shouted in his fury; but it was to be concluded that his wrath
      was not kindled by the expressed doubt as to Kapiton&rsquo;s existence. This was
      his scapegoat; but his excitement was caused by something quite different.
      As a rule he would have merely shouted down the doubt as to Kapiton, told
      a long yarn about his friend, and eventually retired upstairs to his room.
      But today, in the strange uncertainty of human nature, it seemed to
      require but so small an offence as this to make his cup to overflow. The
      old man grew purple in the face, he raised his hands. &ldquo;Enough of this!&rdquo; he
      yelled. &ldquo;My curse&mdash;away, out of the house I go! Colia, bring my bag
      away!&rdquo; He left the room hastily and in a paroxysm of rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife, Colia, and Ptitsin ran out after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you done now?&rdquo; said Varia to Gania. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll probably be making
      off <i>there</i> again! What a disgrace it all is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he shouldn&rsquo;t steal,&rdquo; cried Gania, panting with fury. And just at
      this moment his eye met Hippolyte&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for you, sir,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you should at least remember that you are in
      a strange house and&mdash;receiving hospitality; you should not take the
      opportunity of tormenting an old man, sir, who is too evidently out of his
      mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hippolyte looked furious, but he restrained himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite agree with you that your father is out of his mind,&rdquo; he
      observed, quietly. &ldquo;On the contrary, I cannot help thinking he has been
      less demented of late. Don&rsquo;t you think so? He has grown so cunning and
      careful, and weighs his words so deliberately; he spoke to me about that
      Kapiton fellow with an object, you know! Just fancy&mdash;he wanted me to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, devil take what he wanted you to do! Don&rsquo;t try to be too cunning with
      me, young man!&rdquo; shouted Gania. &ldquo;If you are aware of the real reason for my
      father&rsquo;s present condition (and you have kept such an excellent spying
      watch during these last few days that you are sure to be aware of it)&mdash;you
      had no right whatever to torment the&mdash;unfortunate man, and to worry
      my mother by your exaggerations of the affair; because the whole business
      is nonsense&mdash;simply a drunken freak, and nothing more, quite unproved
      by any evidence, and I don&rsquo;t believe that much of it!&rdquo; (he snapped his
      fingers). &ldquo;But you must needs spy and watch over us all, because you are a&mdash;a&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Screw!&rdquo; laughed Hippolyte.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you are a humbug, sir; and thought fit to worry people for half
      an hour, and tried to frighten them into believing that you would shoot
      yourself with your little empty pistol, pirouetting about and playing at
      suicide! I gave you hospitality, you have fattened on it, your cough has
      left you, and you repay all this&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me&mdash;two words! I am Varvara Ardalionovna&rsquo;s guest, not yours;
      <i>you</i> have extended no hospitality to me. On the contrary, if I am
      not mistaken, I believe you are yourself indebted to Mr. Ptitsin&rsquo;s
      hospitality. Four days ago I begged my mother to come down here and find
      lodgings, because I certainly do feel better here, though I am not fat,
      nor have I ceased to cough. I am today informed that my room is ready for
      me; therefore, having thanked your sister and mother for their kindness to
      me, I intend to leave the house this evening. I beg your pardon&mdash;I
      interrupted you&mdash;I think you were about to add something?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;if that is the state of affairs&mdash;&rdquo; began Gania.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me&mdash;I will take a seat,&rdquo; interrupted Hippolyte once more,
      sitting down deliberately; &ldquo;for I am not strong yet. Now then, I am ready
      to hear you. Especially as this is the last chance we shall have of a
      talk, and very likely the last meeting we shall ever have at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gania felt a little guilty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you I did not mean to reckon up debits and credits,&rdquo; he began,
      &ldquo;and if you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand your condescension,&rdquo; said Hippolyte. &ldquo;As for me, I
      promised myself, on the first day of my arrival in this house, that I
      would have the satisfaction of settling accounts with you in a very
      thorough manner before I said good-bye to you. I intend to perform this
      operation now, if you like; after you, though, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask you to be so good as to leave this room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better speak out. You&rsquo;ll be sorry afterwards if you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hippolyte, stop, please! It&rsquo;s so dreadfully undignified,&rdquo; said Varia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, only for the sake of a lady,&rdquo; said Hippolyte, laughing. &ldquo;I am ready
      to put off the reckoning, but only put it off, Varvara Ardalionovna,
      because an explanation between your brother and myself has become an
      absolute necessity, and I could not think of leaving the house without
      clearing up all misunderstandings first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a word, you are a wretched little scandal-monger,&rdquo; cried Gania, &ldquo;and
      you cannot go away without a scandal!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said Hippolyte, coolly, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t restrain yourself. You&rsquo;ll be
      dreadfully sorry afterwards if you don&rsquo;t speak out now. Come, you shall
      have the first say. I&rsquo;ll wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gania was silent and merely looked contemptuously at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t? Very well. I shall be as short as possible, for my part. Two
      or three times to-day I have had the word &lsquo;hospitality&rsquo; pushed down my
      throat; this is not fair. In inviting me here you yourself entrapped me
      for your own use; you thought I wished to revenge myself upon the prince.
      You heard that Aglaya Ivanovna had been kind to me and read my confession.
      Making sure that I should give myself up to your interests, you hoped that
      you might get some assistance out of me. I will not go into details. I
      don&rsquo;t ask either admission or confirmation of this from yourself; I am
      quite content to leave you to your conscience, and to feel that we
      understand one another capitally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a history you are weaving out of the most ordinary circumstances!&rdquo;
       cried Varia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you the fellow was nothing but a scandal-monger,&rdquo; said Gania.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, Varia Ardalionovna, I will proceed. I can, of course, neither
      love nor respect the prince, though he is a good-hearted fellow, if a
      little queer. But there is no need whatever for me to hate him. I quite
      understood your brother when he first offered me aid against the prince,
      though I did not show it; I knew well that your brother was making a
      ridiculous mistake in me. I am ready to spare him, however, even now; but
      solely out of respect for yourself, Varvara Ardalionovna.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Having now shown you that I am not quite such a fool as I look, and that
      I have to be fished for with a rod and line for a good long while before I
      am caught, I will proceed to explain why I specially wished to make your
      brother look a fool. That my motive power is hate, I do not attempt to
      conceal. I have felt that before dying (and I am dying, however much
      fatter I may appear to you), I must absolutely make a fool of, at least,
      one of that class of men which has dogged me all my life, which I hate so
      cordially, and which is so prominently represented by your much esteemed
      brother. I should not enjoy paradise nearly so much without having done
      this first. I hate you, Gavrila Ardalionovitch, solely (this may seem
      curious to you, but I repeat)&mdash;solely because you are the type, and
      incarnation, and head, and crown of the most impudent, the most
      self-satisfied, the most vulgar and detestable form of commonplaceness.
      You are ordinary of the ordinary; you have no chance of ever fathering the
      pettiest idea of your own. And yet you are as jealous and conceited as you
      can possibly be; you consider yourself a great genius; of this you are
      persuaded, although there are dark moments of doubt and rage, when even
      this fact seems uncertain. There are spots of darkness on your horizon,
      though they will disappear when you become completely stupid. But a long
      and chequered path lies before you, and of this I am glad. In the first
      place you will never gain a certain person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come! This is intolerable! You had better stop, you little
      mischief-making wretch!&rdquo; cried Varia. Gania had grown very pale; he
      trembled, but said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hippolyte paused, and looked at him intently and with great gratification.
      He then turned his gaze upon Varia, bowed, and went out, without adding
      another word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gania might justly complain of the hardness with which fate treated him.
      Varia dared not speak to him for a long while, as he strode past her,
      backwards and forwards. At last he went and stood at the window, looking
      out, with his back turned towards her. There was a fearful row going on
      upstairs again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you off?&rdquo; said Gania, suddenly, remarking that she had risen and was
      about to leave the room. &ldquo;Wait a moment&mdash;look at this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He approached the table and laid a small sheet of paper before her. It
      looked like a little note.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; cried Varia, raising her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the note:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &ldquo;<span class="sc">Gavrila Ardolionovitch</span>,&mdash;persuaded of your
        kindness of heart, I have determined to ask your advice on a matter of
        great importance to myself. I should like to meet you tomorrow morning
        at seven o&rsquo;clock by the green bench in the park. It is not far from our
        house. Varvara Ardalionovna, who must accompany you, knows the place
        well.
      </p>
      <p class="sig">
        &ldquo;A. E.&rdquo;
       </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth is one to make of a girl like that?&rdquo; said Varia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gania, little as he felt inclined for swagger at this moment, could not
      avoid showing his triumph, especially just after such humiliating remarks
      as those of Hippolyte. A smile of self-satisfaction beamed on his face,
      and Varia too was brimming over with delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this is the very day that they were to announce the engagement! What
      will she do next?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you suppose she wants to talk about tomorrow?&rdquo; asked Gania.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, <i>that&rsquo;s</i> all the same! The chief thing is that she wants to see
      you after six months&rsquo; absence. Look here, Gania, this is a <i>serious</i>
      business. Don&rsquo;t swagger again and lose the game&mdash;play carefully, but
      don&rsquo;t funk, do you understand? As if she could possibly avoid seeing what
      I have been working for all this last six months! And just imagine, I was
      there this morning and not a word of this! I was there, you know, on the
      sly. The old lady did not know, or she would have kicked me out. I ran
      some risk for you, you see. I did so want to find out, at all hazards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here there was a frantic noise upstairs once more; several people seemed
      to be rushing downstairs at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Gania,&rdquo; cried Varia, frightened, &ldquo;we can&rsquo;t let him go out! We can&rsquo;t
      afford to have a breath of scandal about the town at this moment. Run
      after him and beg his pardon&mdash;quick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the father of the family was out in the road already. Colia was
      carrying his bag for him; Nina Alexandrovna stood and cried on the
      doorstep; she wanted to run after the general, but Ptitsin kept her back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will only excite him more,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He has nowhere else to go to&mdash;he&rsquo;ll
      be back here in half an hour. I&rsquo;ve talked it all over with Colia; let him
      play the fool a bit, it will do him good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you up to? Where are you off to? You&rsquo;ve nowhere to go to, you
      know,&rdquo; cried Gania, out of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come back, father; the neighbours will hear!&rdquo; cried Varia.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general stopped, turned round, raised his hands and remarked: &ldquo;My
      curse be upon this house!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which observation should always be made in as theatrical a tone as
      possible,&rdquo; muttered Gania, shutting the window with a bang.
    </p>
    <p>
      The neighbours undoubtedly did hear. Varia rushed out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner had his sister left him alone, than Gania took the note out of
      his pocket, kissed it, and pirouetted around.
    </p>
    <h3>
      III.
    </h3>
    <p>
      As a general rule, old General Ivolgin&rsquo;s paroxysms ended in smoke. He had
      before this experienced fits of sudden fury, but not very often, because
      he was really a man of peaceful and kindly disposition. He had tried
      hundreds of times to overcome the dissolute habits which he had contracted
      of late years. He would suddenly remember that he was &ldquo;a father,&rdquo; would be
      reconciled with his wife, and shed genuine tears. His feeling for Nina
      Alexandrovna amounted almost to adoration; she had pardoned so much in
      silence, and loved him still in spite of the state of degradation into
      which he had fallen. But the general&rsquo;s struggles with his own weakness
      never lasted very long. He was, in his way, an impetuous man, and a quiet
      life of repentance in the bosom of his family soon became insupportable to
      him. In the end he rebelled, and flew into rages which he regretted,
      perhaps, even as he gave way to them, but which were beyond his control.
      He picked quarrels with everyone, began to hold forth eloquently, exacted
      unlimited respect, and at last disappeared from the house, and sometimes
      did not return for a long time. He had given up interfering in the affairs
      of his family for two years now, and knew nothing about them but what he
      gathered from hearsay.
    </p>
    <p>
      But on this occasion there was something more serious than usual. Everyone
      seemed to know something, but to be afraid to talk about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general had turned up in the bosom of his family two or three days
      before, but not, as usual, with the olive branch of peace in his hand, not
      in the garb of penitence&mdash;in which he was usually clad on such
      occasions&mdash;but, on the contrary, in an uncommonly bad temper. He had
      arrived in a quarrelsome mood, pitching into everyone he came across, and
      talking about all sorts and kinds of subjects in the most unexpected
      manner, so that it was impossible to discover what it was that was really
      putting him out. At moments he would be apparently quite bright and happy;
      but as a rule he would sit moody and thoughtful. He would abruptly
      commence to hold forth about the Epanchins, about Lebedeff, or the prince,
      and equally abruptly would stop short and refuse to speak another word,
      answering all further questions with a stupid smile, unconscious that he
      was smiling, or that he had been asked a question. The whole of the
      previous night he had spent tossing about and groaning, and poor Nina
      Alexandrovna had been busy making cold compresses and warm fomentations
      and so on, without being very clear how to apply them. He had fallen
      asleep after a while, but not for long, and had awaked in a state of
      violent hypochondria which had ended in his quarrel with Hippolyte, and
      the solemn cursing of Ptitsin&rsquo;s establishment generally. It was also
      observed during those two or three days that he was in a state of morbid
      self-esteem, and was specially touchy on all points of honour. Colia
      insisted, in discussing the matter with his mother, that all this was but
      the outcome of abstinence from drink, or perhaps of pining after Lebedeff,
      with whom up to this time the general had been upon terms of the greatest
      friendship; but with whom, for some reason or other, he had quarrelled a
      few days since, parting from him in great wrath. There had also been a
      scene with the prince. Colia had asked an explanation of the latter, but
      had been forced to conclude that he was not told the whole truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Hippolyte and Nina Alexandrovna had, as Gania suspected, had some
      special conversation about the general&rsquo;s actions, it was strange that the
      malicious youth, whom Gania had called a scandal-monger to his face, had
      not allowed himself a similar satisfaction with Colia.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact is that probably Hippolyte was not quite so black as Gania
      painted him; and it was hardly likely that he had informed Nina
      Alexandrovna of certain events, of which we know, for the mere pleasure of
      giving her pain. We must never forget that human motives are generally far
      more complicated than we are apt to suppose, and that we can very rarely
      accurately describe the motives of another. It is much better for the
      writer, as a rule, to content himself with the bare statement of events;
      and we shall take this line with regard to the catastrophe recorded above,
      and shall state the remaining events connected with the general&rsquo;s trouble
      shortly, because we feel that we have already given to this secondary
      character in our story more attention than we originally intended.
    </p>
    <p>
      The course of events had marched in the following order. When Lebedeff
      returned, in company with the general, after their expedition to town a
      few days since, for the purpose of investigation, he brought the prince no
      information whatever. If the latter had not himself been occupied with
      other thoughts and impressions at the time, he must have observed that
      Lebedeff not only was very uncommunicative, but even appeared anxious to
      avoid him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the prince did give the matter a little attention, he recalled the
      fact that during these days he had always found Lebedeff to be in
      radiantly good spirits, when they happened to meet; and further, that the
      general and Lebedeff were always together. The two friends did not seem
      ever to be parted for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Occasionally the prince heard loud talking and laughing upstairs, and once
      he detected the sound of a jolly soldier&rsquo;s song going on above, and
      recognized the unmistakable bass of the general&rsquo;s voice. But the sudden
      outbreak of song did not last; and for an hour afterwards the animated
      sound of apparently drunken conversation continued to be heard from above.
      At length there was the clearest evidence of a grand mutual embracing, and
      someone burst into tears. Shortly after this, however, there was a violent
      but short-lived quarrel, with loud talking on both sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these days Colia had been in a state of great mental preoccupation.
      Muishkin was usually out all day, and only came home late at night. On his
      return he was invariably informed that Colia had been looking for him.
      However, when they did meet, Colia never had anything particular to tell
      him, excepting that he was highly dissatisfied with the general and his
      present condition of mind and behaviour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They drag each other about the place,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and get drunk together
      at the pub close by here, and quarrel in the street on the way home, and
      embrace one another after it, and don&rsquo;t seem to part for a moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the prince pointed out that there was nothing new about that, for
      that they had always behaved in this manner together, Colia did not know
      what to say; in fact he could not explain what it was that specially
      worried him, just now, about his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morning following the bacchanalian songs and quarrels recorded
      above, as the prince stepped out of the house at about eleven o&rsquo;clock, the
      general suddenly appeared before him, much agitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have long sought the honour and opportunity of meeting you&mdash;much-esteemed
      Lef Nicolaievitch,&rdquo; he murmured, pressing the prince&rsquo;s hand very hard,
      almost painfully so; &ldquo;long&mdash;very long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince begged him to step in and sit down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;I will not sit down,&mdash;I am keeping you, I see,&mdash;another
      time!&mdash;I think I may be permitted to congratulate you upon the
      realization of your heart&rsquo;s best wishes, is it not so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What best wishes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince blushed. He thought, as so many in his position do, that nobody
      had seen, heard, noticed, or understood anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;be easy, sir, be easy! I shall not wound your tenderest
      feelings. I&rsquo;ve been through it all myself, and I know well how unpleasant
      it is when an outsider sticks his nose in where he is not wanted. I
      experience this every morning. I came to speak to you about another
      matter, though, an important matter. A very important matter, prince.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The latter requested him to take a seat once more, and sat down himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;just for one second, then. The fact is, I came for advice. Of
      course I live now without any very practical objects in life; but, being
      full of self-respect, in which quality the ordinary Russian is so
      deficient as a rule, and of activity, I am desirous, in a word, prince, of
      placing myself and my wife and children in a position of&mdash;in fact, I
      want advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince commended his aspirations with warmth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so&mdash;quite so! But this is all mere nonsense. I came here to
      speak of something quite different, something very important, prince. And
      I have determined to come to you as to a man in whose sincerity and
      nobility of feeling I can trust like&mdash;like&mdash;are you surprised at
      my words, prince?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince was watching his guest, if not with much surprise, at all
      events with great attention and curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man was very pale; every now and then his lips trembled, and his
      hands seemed unable to rest quietly, but continually moved from place to
      place. He had twice already jumped up from his chair and sat down again
      without being in the least aware of it. He would take up a book from the
      table and open it&mdash;talking all the while,&mdash;look at the heading
      of a chapter, shut it and put it back again, seizing another immediately,
      but holding it unopened in his hand, and waving it in the air as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But enough!&rdquo; he cried, suddenly. &ldquo;I see I have been boring you with my&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in the least&mdash;not in the least, I assure you. On the contrary, I
      am listening most attentively, and am anxious to guess&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prince, I wish to place myself in a respectable position&mdash;I wish to
      esteem myself&mdash;and to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sir, a man of such noble aspirations is worthy of all esteem by
      virtue of those aspirations alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince brought out his &ldquo;copy-book sentence&rdquo; in the firm belief that it
      would produce a good effect. He felt instinctively that some such
      well-sounding humbug, brought out at the proper moment, would soothe the
      old man&rsquo;s feelings, and would be specially acceptable to such a man in
      such a position. At all hazards, his guest must be despatched with heart
      relieved and spirit comforted; that was the problem before the prince at
      this moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The phrase flattered the general, touched him, and pleased him mightily.
      He immediately changed his tone, and started off on a long and solemn
      explanation. But listen as he would, the prince could make neither head
      nor tail of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general spoke hotly and quickly for ten minutes; he spoke as though
      his words could not keep pace with his crowding thoughts. Tears stood in
      his eyes, and yet his speech was nothing but a collection of disconnected
      sentences, without beginning and without end&mdash;a string of unexpected
      words and unexpected sentiments&mdash;colliding with one another, and
      jumping over one another, as they burst from his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough!&rdquo; he concluded at last, &ldquo;you understand me, and that is the great
      thing. A heart like yours cannot help understanding the sufferings of
      another. Prince, you are the ideal of generosity; what are other men
      beside yourself? But you are young&mdash;accept my blessing! My principal
      object is to beg you to fix an hour for a most important conversation&mdash;that
      is my great hope, prince. My heart needs but a little friendship and
      sympathy, and yet I cannot always find means to satisfy it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why not now? I am ready to listen, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no&mdash;prince, not now! Now is a dream! And it is too, too
      important! It is to be the hour of Fate to me&mdash;<i>my own</i> hour.
      Our interview is not to be broken in upon by every chance comer, every
      impertinent guest&mdash;and there are plenty of such stupid, impertinent
      fellows&rdquo;&mdash;(he bent over and whispered mysteriously, with a funny,
      frightened look on his face)&mdash;&ldquo;who are unworthy to tie your shoe,
      prince. I don&rsquo;t say <i>mine</i>, mind&mdash;you will understand me,
      prince. Only <i>you</i> understand me, prince&mdash;no one else. <i>He</i>
      doesn&rsquo;t understand me, he is absolutely&mdash;<i>absolutely</i> unable to
      sympathize. The first qualification for understanding another is Heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince was rather alarmed at all this, and was obliged to end by
      appointing the same hour of the following day for the interview desired.
      The general left him much comforted and far less agitated than when he had
      arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      At seven in the evening, the prince sent to request Lebedeff to pay him a
      visit. Lebedeff came at once, and &ldquo;esteemed it an honour,&rdquo; as he observed,
      the instant he entered the room. He acted as though there had never been
      the slightest suspicion of the fact that he had systematically avoided the
      prince for the last three days.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down on the edge of his chair, smiling and making faces, and
      rubbing his hands, and looking as though he were in delighted expectation
      of hearing some important communication, which had been long guessed by
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince was instantly covered with confusion; for it appeared to be
      plain that everyone expected something of him&mdash;that everyone looked
      at him as though anxious to congratulate him, and greeted him with hints,
      and smiles, and knowing looks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keller, for instance, had run into the house three times of late, &ldquo;just
      for a moment,&rdquo; and each time with the air of desiring to offer his
      congratulations. Colia, too, in spite of his melancholy, had once or twice
      begun sentences in much the same strain of suggestion or insinuation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince, however, immediately began, with some show of annoyance, to
      question Lebedeff categorically, as to the general&rsquo;s present condition,
      and his opinion thereon. He described the morning&rsquo;s interview in a few
      words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everyone has his worries, prince, especially in these strange and
      troublous times of ours,&rdquo; Lebedeff replied, drily, and with the air of a
      man disappointed of his reasonable expectations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me, what a philosopher you are!&rdquo; laughed the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Philosophy is necessary, sir&mdash;very necessary&mdash;in our day. It is
      too much neglected. As for me, much esteemed prince, I am sensible of
      having experienced the honour of your confidence in a certain matter up to
      a certain point, but never beyond that point. I do not for a moment
      complain&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lebedeff, you seem to be angry for some reason!&rdquo; said the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the least bit in the world, esteemed and revered prince! Not the
      least bit in the world!&rdquo; cried Lebedeff, solemnly, with his hand upon his
      heart. &ldquo;On the contrary, I am too painfully aware that neither by my
      position in the world, nor by my gifts of intellect and heart, nor by my
      riches, nor by any former conduct of mine, have I in any way deserved your
      confidence, which is far above my highest aspirations and hopes. Oh no,
      prince; I may serve you, but only as your humble slave! I am not angry, oh
      no! Not angry; pained perhaps, but nothing more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Lebedeff, I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothing more, nothing more! I was saying to myself but now... &lsquo;I am
      quite unworthy of friendly relations with him,&rsquo; say I; &lsquo;but perhaps as
      landlord of this house I may, at some future date, in his good time,
      receive information as to certain imminent and much to be desired changes&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying Lebedeff fixed the prince with his sharp little eyes, still in
      hope that he would get his curiosity satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince looked back at him in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand what you are driving at!&rdquo; he cried, almost angrily,
      &ldquo;and, and&mdash;what an intriguer you are, Lebedeff!&rdquo; he added, bursting
      into a fit of genuine laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lebedeff followed suit at once, and it was clear from his radiant face
      that he considered his prospects of satisfaction immensely improved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you know,&rdquo; the prince continued, &ldquo;I am amazed at your naive ways,
      Lebedeff! Don&rsquo;t be angry with me&mdash;not only yours, everybody else&rsquo;s
      also! You are waiting to hear something from me at this very moment with
      such simplicity that I declare I feel quite ashamed of myself for having
      nothing whatever to tell you. I swear to you solemnly, that there is
      nothing to tell. There! Can you take that in?&rdquo; The prince laughed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lebedeff assumed an air of dignity. It was true enough that he was
      sometimes naive to a degree in his curiosity; but he was also an
      excessively cunning gentleman, and the prince was almost converting him
      into an enemy by his repeated rebuffs. The prince did not snub Lebedeff&rsquo;s
      curiosity, however, because he felt any contempt for him; but simply
      because the subject was too delicate to talk about. Only a few days before
      he had looked upon his own dreams almost as crimes. But Lebedeff
      considered the refusal as caused by personal dislike to himself, and was
      hurt accordingly. Indeed, there was at this moment a piece of news, most
      interesting to the prince, which Lebedeff knew and even had wished to tell
      him, but which he now kept obstinately to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what can I do for you, esteemed prince? Since I am told you sent for
      me just now,&rdquo; he said, after a few moments&rsquo; silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it was about the general,&rdquo; began the prince, waking abruptly from the
      fit of musing which he too had indulged in &ldquo;and&mdash;and about the theft
      you told me of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is&mdash;er&mdash;about&mdash;what theft?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh come! just as if you didn&rsquo;t understand, Lukian Timofeyovitch! What are
      you up to? I can&rsquo;t make you out! The money, the money, sir! The four
      hundred roubles that you lost that day. You came and told me about it one
      morning, and then went off to Petersburg. There, <i>now</i> do you
      understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;h&mdash;h! You mean the four hundred roubles!&rdquo; said Lebedeff,
      dragging the words out, just as though it had only just dawned upon him
      what the prince was talking about. &ldquo;Thanks very much, prince, for your
      kind interest&mdash;you do me too much honour. I found the money, long
      ago!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You found it? Thank God for that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your exclamation proves the generous sympathy of your nature, prince; for
      four hundred roubles&mdash;to a struggling family man like myself&mdash;is
      no small matter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean that; at least, of course, I&rsquo;m glad for your sake, too,&rdquo;
       added the prince, correcting himself, &ldquo;but&mdash;how did you find it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very simply indeed! I found it under the chair upon which my coat had
      hung; so that it is clear the purse simply fell out of the pocket and on
      to the floor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Under the chair? Impossible! Why, you told me yourself that you had
      searched every corner of the room? How could you not have looked in the
      most likely place of all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I looked there,&mdash;of course I did! Very much so! I looked
      and scrambled about, and felt for it, and wouldn&rsquo;t believe it was not
      there, and looked again and again. It is always so in such cases. One
      longs and expects to find a lost article; one sees it is not there, and
      the place is as bare as one&rsquo;s palm; and yet one returns and looks again
      and again, fifteen or twenty times, likely enough!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, quite so, of course. But how was it in your case?&mdash;I don&rsquo;t quite
      understand,&rdquo; said the bewildered prince. &ldquo;You say it wasn&rsquo;t there at
      first, and that you searched the place thoroughly, and yet it turned up on
      that very spot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir&mdash;on that very spot.&rdquo; The prince gazed strangely at
      Lebedeff. &ldquo;And the general?&rdquo; he asked, abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The&mdash;the general? How do you mean, the general?&rdquo; said Lebedeff,
      dubiously, as though he had not taken in the drift of the prince&rsquo;s remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, good heavens! I mean, what did the general say when the purse turned
      up under the chair? You and he had searched for it together there, hadn&rsquo;t
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so&mdash;together! But the second time I thought better to say
      nothing about finding it. I found it alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;why in the world&mdash;and the money? Was it all there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I opened the purse and counted it myself; right to a single rouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you might have come and told me,&rdquo; said the prince, thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t like to disturb you, prince, in the midst of your
      private and doubtless most interesting personal reflections. Besides, I
      wanted to appear, myself, to have found nothing. I took the purse, and
      opened it, and counted the money, and shut it and put it down again under
      the chair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What in the world for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, just out of curiosity,&rdquo; said Lebedeff, rubbing his hands and
      sniggering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, it&rsquo;s still there then, is it? Ever since the day before yesterday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no! You see, I was half in hopes the general might find it. Because if
      I found it, why should not he too observe an object lying before his very
      eyes? I moved the chair several times so as to expose the purse to view,
      but the general never saw it. He is very absent just now, evidently. He
      talks and laughs and tells stories, and suddenly flies into a rage with
      me, goodness knows why.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but&mdash;have you taken the purse away now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it disappeared from under the chair in the night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is it now, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; laughed Lebedeff, at last, rising to his full height and looking
      pleasantly at the prince, &ldquo;here, in the lining of my coat. Look, you can
      feel it for yourself, if you like!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sure enough there was something sticking out of the front of the coat&mdash;something
      large. It certainly felt as though it might well be the purse fallen
      through a hole in the pocket into the lining.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I took it out and had a look at it; it&rsquo;s all right. I&rsquo;ve let it slip back
      into the lining now, as you see, and so I have been walking about ever
      since yesterday morning; it knocks against my legs when I walk along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m! and you take no notice of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so, I take no notice of it. Ha, ha! and think of this, prince, my
      pockets are always strong and whole, and yet, here in one night, is a huge
      hole. I know the phenomenon is unworthy of your notice; but such is the
      case. I examined the hole, and I declare it actually looks as though it
      had been made with a pen-knife, a most improbable contingency.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&mdash;and&mdash;the general?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, very angry all day, sir; all yesterday and all today. He shows
      decided bacchanalian predilections at one time, and at another is tearful
      and sensitive, but at any moment he is liable to paroxysms of such rage
      that I assure you, prince, I am quite alarmed. I am not a military man,
      you know. Yesterday we were sitting together in the tavern, and the lining
      of my coat was&mdash;quite accidentally, of course&mdash;sticking out
      right in front. The general squinted at it, and flew into a rage. He never
      looks me quite in the face now, unless he is very drunk or maudlin; but
      yesterday he looked at me in such a way that a shiver went all down my
      back. I intend to find the purse tomorrow; but till then I am going to
      have another night of it with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the good of tormenting him like this?&rdquo; cried the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t torment him, prince, I don&rsquo;t indeed!&rdquo; cried Lebedeff, hotly. &ldquo;I
      love him, my dear sir, I esteem him; and believe it or not, I love him all
      the better for this business, yes&mdash;and value him more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lebedeff said this so seriously that the prince quite lost his temper with
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! love him and torment him so! Why, by the very fact that he put
      the purse prominently before you, first under the chair and then in your
      lining, he shows that he does not wish to deceive you, but is anxious to
      beg your forgiveness in this artless way. Do you hear? He is asking your
      pardon. He confides in the delicacy of your feelings, and in your
      friendship for him. And you can allow yourself to humiliate so thoroughly
      honest a man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thoroughly honest, quite so, prince, thoroughly honest!&rdquo; said Lebedeff,
      with flashing eyes. &ldquo;And only you, prince, could have found so very
      appropriate an expression. I honour you for it, prince. Very well, that&rsquo;s
      settled; I shall find the purse now and not tomorrow. Here, I find it and
      take it out before your eyes! And the money is all right. Take it, prince,
      and keep it till tomorrow, will you? Tomorrow or next day I&rsquo;ll take it
      back again. I think, prince, that the night after its disappearance it was
      buried under a bush in the garden. So I believe&mdash;what do you think of
      that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, take care you don&rsquo;t tell him to his face that you have found the
      purse. Simply let him see that it is no longer in the lining of your coat,
      and form his own conclusions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think so? Had I not just better tell him I have found it, and
      pretend I never guessed where it was?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; said the prince, thoughtfully; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s too late for
      that&mdash;that would be dangerous now. No, no! Better say nothing about
      it. Be nice with him, you know, but don&rsquo;t show him&mdash;oh, <i>you</i>
      know well enough&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, prince, of course I know, but I&rsquo;m afraid I shall not carry it
      out; for to do so one needs a heart like your own. He is so very irritable
      just now, and so proud. At one moment he will embrace me, and the next he
      flies out at me and sneers at me, and then I stick the lining forward on
      purpose. Well, <i>au revoir</i>, prince, I see I am keeping you, and
      boring you, too, interfering with your most interesting private
      reflections.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, do be careful! Secrecy, as before!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, silence isn&rsquo;t the word! Softly, softly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But in spite of this conclusion to the episode, the prince remained as
      puzzled as ever, if not more so. He awaited next morning&rsquo;s interview with
      the general most impatiently.
    </p>
    <h3>
      IV.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The time appointed was twelve o&rsquo;clock, and the prince, returning home
      unexpectedly late, found the general waiting for him. At the first glance,
      he saw that the latter was displeased, perhaps because he had been kept
      waiting. The prince apologized, and quickly took a seat. He seemed
      strangely timid before the general this morning, for some reason, and felt
      as though his visitor were some piece of china which he was afraid of
      breaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      On scrutinizing him, the prince soon saw that the general was quite a
      different man from what he had been the day before; he looked like one who
      had come to some momentous resolve. His calmness, however, was more
      apparent than real. He was courteous, but there was a suggestion of
      injured innocence in his manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve brought your book back,&rdquo; he began, indicating a book lying on the
      table. &ldquo;Much obliged to you for lending it to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes. Well, did you read it, general? It&rsquo;s curious, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said
      the prince, delighted to be able to open up conversation upon an outside
      subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Curious enough, yes, but crude, and of course dreadful nonsense; probably
      the man lies in every other sentence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The general spoke with considerable confidence, and dragged his words out
      with a conceited drawl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but it&rsquo;s only the simple tale of an old soldier who saw the French
      enter Moscow. Some of his remarks were wonderfully interesting. Remarks of
      an eye-witness are always valuable, whoever he be, don&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had I been the publisher I should not have printed it. As to the evidence
      of eye-witnesses, in these days people prefer impudent lies to the stories
      of men of worth and long service. I know of some notes of the year 1812,
      which&mdash;I have determined, prince, to leave this house, Mr. Lebedeff&rsquo;s
      house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The general looked significantly at his host.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you have your own lodging at Pavlofsk at&mdash;at your
      daughter&rsquo;s house,&rdquo; began the prince, quite at a loss what to say. He
      suddenly recollected that the general had come for advice on a most
      important matter, affecting his destiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At my wife&rsquo;s; in other words, at my own place, my daughter&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I leave Lebedeff&rsquo;s house, my dear prince, because I have quarrelled with
      this person. I broke with him last night, and am very sorry that I did not
      do so before. I expect respect, prince, even from those to whom I give my
      heart, so to speak. Prince, I have often given away my heart, and am
      nearly always deceived. This person was quite unworthy of the gift.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is much that might be improved in him,&rdquo; said the prince,
      moderately, &ldquo;but he has some qualities which&mdash;though amid them one
      cannot but discern a cunning nature&mdash;reveal what is often a diverting
      intellect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince&rsquo;s tone was so natural and respectful that the general could not
      possibly suspect him of any insincerity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that he possesses good traits, I was the first to show, when I very
      nearly made him a present of my friendship. I am not dependent upon his
      hospitality, and upon his house; I have my own family. I do not attempt to
      justify my own weakness. I have drunk with this man, and perhaps I deplore
      the fact now, but I did not take him up for the sake of drink alone
      (excuse the crudeness of the expression, prince); I did not make friends
      with him for that alone. I was attracted by his good qualities; but when
      the fellow declares that he was a child in 1812, and had his left leg cut
      off, and buried in the Vagarkoff cemetery, in Moscow, such a cock-and-bull
      story amounts to disrespect, my dear sir, to&mdash;to impudent
      exaggeration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he was very likely joking; he said it for fun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I quite understand you. You mean that an innocent lie for the sake of a
      good joke is harmless, and does not offend the human heart. Some people
      lie, if you like to put it so, out of pure friendship, in order to amuse
      their fellows; but when a man makes use of extravagance in order to show
      his disrespect and to make clear how the intimacy bores him, it is time
      for a man of honour to break off the said intimacy, and to teach the
      offender his place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The general flushed with indignation as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but Lebedeff cannot have been in Moscow in 1812. He is much too
      young; it is all nonsense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, but even if we admit that he <i>was</i> alive in 1812, can one
      believe that a French chasseur pointed a cannon at him for a lark, and
      shot his left leg off? He says he picked his own leg up and took it away
      and buried it in the cemetery. He swore he had a stone put up over it with
      the inscription: &lsquo;Here lies the leg of Collegiate Secretary Lebedeff,&rsquo; and
      on the other side, &lsquo;Rest, beloved ashes, till the morn of joy,&rsquo; and that
      he has a service read over it every year (which is simply sacrilege), and
      goes to Moscow once a year on purpose. He invites me to Moscow in order to
      prove his assertion, and show me his leg&rsquo;s tomb, and the very cannon that
      shot him; he says it&rsquo;s the eleventh from the gate of the Kremlin, an
      old-fashioned falconet taken from the French afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, meanwhile both his legs are still on his body,&rdquo; said the prince,
      laughing. &ldquo;I assure you, it is only an innocent joke, and you need not be
      angry about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me&mdash;wait a minute&mdash;he says that the leg we see is a
      wooden one, made by Tchernosvitoff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They do say one can dance with those!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so, quite so; and he swears that his wife never found out that one
      of his legs was wooden all the while they were married. When I showed him
      the ridiculousness of all this, he said, &lsquo;Well, if you were one of
      Napoleon&rsquo;s pages in 1812, you might let me bury my leg in the Moscow
      cemetery.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, did you say&mdash;&rdquo; began the prince, and paused in confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general gazed at his host disdainfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, go on,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;finish your sentence, by all means. Say how odd it
      appears to you that a man fallen to such a depth of humiliation as I, can
      ever have been the actual eye-witness of great events. Go on, <i>I</i>
      don&rsquo;t mind! Has <i>he</i> found time to tell you scandal about me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ve heard nothing of this from Lebedeff, if you mean Lebedeff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m; I thought differently. You see, we were talking over this period of
      history. I was criticizing a current report of something which then
      happened, and having been myself an eye-witness of the occurrence&mdash;you
      are smiling, prince&mdash;you are looking at my face as if&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no! not at all&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am rather young-looking, I know; but I am actually older than I appear
      to be. I was ten or eleven in the year 1812. I don&rsquo;t know my age exactly,
      but it has always been a weakness of mine to make it out less than it
      really is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you, general, I do not in the least doubt your statement. One of
      our living autobiographers states that when he was a small baby in Moscow
      in 1812 the French soldiers fed him with bread.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there you see!&rdquo; said the general, condescendingly. &ldquo;There is
      nothing whatever unusual about my tale. Truth very often appears to be
      impossible. I was a page&mdash;it sounds strange, I dare say. Had I been
      fifteen years old I should probably have been terribly frightened when the
      French arrived, as my mother was (who had been too slow about clearing out
      of Moscow); but as I was only just ten I was not in the least alarmed, and
      rushed through the crowd to the very door of the palace when Napoleon
      alighted from his horse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Undoubtedly, at ten years old you would not have felt the sense of fear,
      as you say,&rdquo; blurted out the prince, horribly uncomfortable in the
      sensation that he was just about to blush.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course; and it all happened so easily and naturally. And yet, were a
      novelist to describe the episode, he would put in all kinds of impossible
      and incredible details.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; cried the prince, &ldquo;I have often thought that! Why, I know of a
      murder, for the sake of a watch. It&rsquo;s in all the papers now. But if some
      writer had invented it, all the critics would have jumped down his throat
      and said the thing was too improbable for anything. And yet you read it in
      the paper, and you can&rsquo;t help thinking that out of these strange
      disclosures is to be gained the full knowledge of Russian life and
      character. You said that well, general; it is so true,&rdquo; concluded the
      prince, warmly, delighted to have found a refuge from the fiery blushes
      which had covered his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s quite true, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; cried the general, his eyes sparkling
      with gratification. &ldquo;A small boy, a child, would naturally realize no
      danger; he would shove his way through the crowds to see the shine and
      glitter of the uniforms, and especially the great man of whom everyone was
      speaking, for at that time all the world had been talking of no one but
      this man for some years past. The world was full of his name; I&mdash;so
      to speak&mdash;drew it in with my mother&rsquo;s milk. Napoleon, passing a
      couple of paces from me, caught sight of me accidentally. I was very well
      dressed, and being all alone, in that crowd, as you will easily imagine...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, of course! Naturally the sight impressed him, and proved to him that
      not <i>all</i> the aristocracy had left Moscow; that at least some nobles
      and their children had remained behind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so! just so! He wanted to win over the aristocracy! When his eagle
      eye fell on me, mine probably flashed back in response. &lsquo;<i>Voilà un
      garçon bien éveillé! Qui est ton père?</i>&rsquo; I immediately replied, almost
      panting with excitement, &lsquo;A general, who died on the battle-fields of his
      country!&rsquo; &lsquo;<i>Le fils d&rsquo;un boyard et d&rsquo;un brave, pardessus le marché.
      J&rsquo;aime les boyards. M&rsquo;aimes-tu, petit?</i>&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To this keen question I replied as keenly, &lsquo;The Russian heart can
      recognize a great man even in the bitter enemy of his country.&rsquo; At least,
      I don&rsquo;t remember the exact words, you know, but the idea was as I say.
      Napoleon was struck; he thought a minute and then said to his suite: &lsquo;I
      like that boy&rsquo;s pride; if all Russians think like this child, then&mdash;&rsquo;
      he didn&rsquo;t finish, but went on and entered the palace. I instantly mixed
      with his suite, and followed him. I was already in high favour. I remember
      when he came into the first hall, the emperor stopped before a portrait of
      the Empress Katherine, and after a thoughtful glance remarked, &lsquo;That was a
      great woman,&rsquo; and passed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, in a couple of days I was known all over the palace and the Kremlin
      as &lsquo;le petit boyard.&rsquo; I only went home to sleep. They were nearly out of
      their minds about me at home. A couple of days after this, Napoleon&rsquo;s
      page, De Bazancour, died; he had not been able to stand the trials of the
      campaign. Napoleon remembered me; I was taken away without explanation;
      the dead page&rsquo;s uniform was tried on me, and when I was taken before the
      emperor, dressed in it, he nodded his head to me, and I was told that I
      was appointed to the vacant post of page.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I was glad enough, for I had long felt the greatest sympathy for
      this man; and then the pretty uniform and all that&mdash;only a child, you
      know&mdash;and so on. It was a dark green dress coat with gold buttons&mdash;red
      facings, white trousers, and a white silk waistcoat&mdash;silk stockings,
      shoes with buckles, and top-boots if I were riding out with his majesty or
      with the suite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Though the position of all of us at that time was not particularly
      brilliant, and the poverty was dreadful all round, yet the etiquette at
      court was strictly preserved, and the more strictly in proportion to the
      growth of the forebodings of disaster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so, quite so, of course!&rdquo; murmured the poor prince, who didn&rsquo;t know
      where to look. &ldquo;Your memoirs would be most interesting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The general was, of course, repeating what he had told Lebedeff the night
      before, and thus brought it out glibly enough, but here he looked
      suspiciously at the prince out of the corners of his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My memoirs!&rdquo; he began, with redoubled pride and dignity. &ldquo;Write my
      memoirs? The idea has not tempted me. And yet, if you please, my memoirs
      have long been written, but they shall not see the light until dust
      returns to dust. Then, I doubt not, they will be translated into all
      languages, not of course on account of their actual literary merit, but
      because of the great events of which I was the actual witness, though but
      a child at the time. As a child, I was able to penetrate into the secrecy
      of the great man&rsquo;s private room. At nights I have heard the groans and
      wailings of this &lsquo;giant in distress.&rsquo; He could feel no shame in weeping
      before such a mere child as I was, though I understood even then that the
      reason for his suffering was the silence of the Emperor Alexander.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of course; he had written letters to the latter with proposals of
      peace, had he not?&rdquo; put in the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We did not know the details of his proposals, but he wrote letter after
      letter, all day and every day. He was dreadfully agitated. Sometimes at
      night I would throw myself upon his breast with tears (Oh, how I loved
      that man!). &lsquo;Ask forgiveness, Oh, ask forgiveness of the Emperor
      Alexander!&rsquo; I would cry. I should have said, of course, &lsquo;Make peace with
      Alexander,&rsquo; but as a child I expressed my idea in the naive way recorded.
      &lsquo;Oh, my child,&rsquo; he would say (he loved to talk to me and seemed to forget
      my tender years), &lsquo;Oh, my child, I am ready to kiss Alexander&rsquo;s feet, but
      I hate and abominate the King of Prussia and the Austrian Emperor, and&mdash;and&mdash;but
      you know nothing of politics, my child.&rsquo; He would pull up, remembering
      whom he was speaking to, but his eyes would sparkle for a long while after
      this. Well now, if I were to describe all this, and I have seen greater
      events than these, all these critical gentlemen of the press and political
      parties&mdash;Oh, no thanks! I&rsquo;m their very humble servant, but no
      thanks!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so&mdash;parties&mdash;you are very right,&rdquo; said the prince. &ldquo;I was
      reading a book about Napoleon and the Waterloo campaign only the other
      day, by Charasse, in which the author does not attempt to conceal his joy
      at Napoleon&rsquo;s discomfiture at every page. Well now, I don&rsquo;t like that; it
      smells of &lsquo;party,&rsquo; you know. You are quite right. And were you much
      occupied with your service under Napoleon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The general was in ecstasies, for the prince&rsquo;s remarks, made, as they
      evidently were, in all seriousness and simplicity, quite dissipated the
      last relics of his suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know Charasse&rsquo;s book! Oh! I was so angry with his work! I wrote to him
      and said&mdash;I forget what, at this moment. You ask whether I was very
      busy under the Emperor? Oh no! I was called &lsquo;page,&rsquo; but hardly took my
      duty seriously. Besides, Napoleon very soon lost hope of conciliating the
      Russians, and he would have forgotten all about me had he not loved me&mdash;for
      personal reasons&mdash;I don&rsquo;t mind saying so now. My heart was greatly
      drawn to him, too. My duties were light. I merely had to be at the palace
      occasionally to escort the Emperor out riding, and that was about all. I
      rode very fairly well. He used to have a ride before dinner, and his suite
      on those occasions were generally Davoust, myself, and Roustan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Constant?&rdquo; said the prince, suddenly, and quite involuntarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; Constant was away then, taking a letter to the Empress Josephine.
      Instead of him there were always a couple of orderlies&mdash;and that was
      all, excepting, of course, the generals and marshals whom Napoleon always
      took with him for the inspection of various localities, and for the sake
      of consultation generally. I remember there was one&mdash;Davoust&mdash;nearly
      always with him&mdash;a big man with spectacles. They used to argue and
      quarrel sometimes. Once they were in the Emperor&rsquo;s study together&mdash;just
      those two and myself&mdash;I was unobserved&mdash;and they argued, and the
      Emperor seemed to be agreeing to something under protest. Suddenly his eye
      fell on me and an idea seemed to flash across him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Child,&rsquo; he said, abruptly. &lsquo;If I were to recognize the Russian orthodox
      religion and emancipate the serfs, do you think Russia would come over to
      me?&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Never!&rsquo; I cried, indignantly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Emperor was much struck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;In the flashing eyes of this patriotic child I read and accept the fiat
      of the Russian people. Enough, Davoust, it is mere phantasy on our part.
      Come, let&rsquo;s hear your other project.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but that was a great idea,&rdquo; said the prince, clearly interested.
      &ldquo;You ascribe it to Davoust, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, at all events, they were consulting together at the time. Of course
      it was the idea of an eagle, and must have originated with Napoleon; but
      the other project was good too&mdash;it was the &lsquo;Conseil du lion!&rsquo; as
      Napoleon called it. This project consisted in a proposal to occupy the
      Kremlin with the whole army; to arm and fortify it scientifically, to kill
      as many horses as could be got, and salt their flesh, and spend the winter
      there; and in spring to fight their way out. Napoleon liked the idea&mdash;it
      attracted him. We rode round the Kremlin walls every day, and Napoleon
      used to give orders where they were to be patched, where built up, where
      pulled down and so on. All was decided at last. They were alone together&mdash;those
      two and myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Napoleon was walking up and down with folded arms. I could not take my
      eyes off his face&mdash;my heart beat loudly and painfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m off,&rsquo; said Davoust. &lsquo;Where to?&rsquo; asked Napoleon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;To salt horse-flesh,&rsquo; said Davoust. Napoleon shuddered&mdash;his fate
      was being decided.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Child,&rsquo; he addressed me suddenly, &lsquo;what do you think of our plan?&rsquo; Of
      course he only applied to me as a sort of toss-up, you know. I turned to
      Davoust and addressed my reply to him. I said, as though inspired:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Escape, general! Go home!&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The project was abandoned; Davoust shrugged his shoulders and went out,
      whispering to himself&mdash;&lsquo;<i>Bah, il devient superstitieux!</i>&rsquo; Next
      morning the order to retreat was given.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All this is most interesting,&rdquo; said the prince, very softly, &ldquo;if it
      really was so&mdash;that is, I mean&mdash;&rdquo; he hastened to correct
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my dear prince,&rdquo; cried the general, who was now so intoxicated with
      his own narrative that he probably could not have pulled up at the most
      patent indiscretion. &ldquo;You say, &lsquo;if it really was so!&rsquo; There was more&mdash;<i>much</i>
      more, I assure you! These are merely a few little political acts. I tell
      you I was the eye-witness of the nightly sorrow and groanings of the great
      man, and of <i>that</i> no one can speak but myself. Towards the end he
      wept no more, though he continued to emit an occasional groan; but his
      face grew more overcast day by day, as though Eternity were wrapping its
      gloomy mantle about him. Occasionally we passed whole hours of silence
      together at night, Roustan snoring in the next room&mdash;that fellow
      slept like a pig. &lsquo;But he&rsquo;s loyal to me and my dynasty,&rsquo; said Napoleon of
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes it was very painful to me, and once he caught me with tears in
      my eyes. He looked at me kindly. &lsquo;You are sorry for me,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;you, my
      child, and perhaps one other child&mdash;my son, the King of Rome&mdash;may
      grieve for me. All the rest hate me; and my brothers are the first to
      betray me in misfortune.&rsquo; I sobbed and threw myself into his arms. He
      could not resist me&mdash;he burst into tears, and our tears mingled as we
      folded each other in a close embrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Write, oh, write a letter to the Empress Josephine!&rsquo; I cried, sobbing.
      Napoleon started, reflected, and said, &lsquo;You remind me of a third heart
      which loves me. Thank you, my friend;&rsquo; and then and there he sat down and
      wrote that letter to Josephine, with which Constant was sent off next
      day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did a good action,&rdquo; said the prince, &ldquo;for in the midst of his angry
      feelings you insinuated a kind thought into his heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so, prince, just so. How well you bring out that fact! Because your
      own heart is good!&rdquo; cried the ecstatic old gentleman, and, strangely
      enough, real tears glistened in his eyes. &ldquo;Yes, prince, it was a wonderful
      spectacle. And, do you know, I all but went off to Paris, and should
      assuredly have shared his solitary exile with him; but, alas, our
      destinies were otherwise ordered! We parted, he to his island, where I am
      sure he thought of the weeping child who had embraced him so
      affectionately at parting in Moscow; and I was sent off to the cadet
      corps, where I found nothing but roughness and harsh discipline. Alas, my
      happy days were done!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I do not wish to deprive your mother of you, and, therefore, I will not
      ask you to go with me,&rsquo; he said, the morning of his departure, &lsquo;but I
      should like to do something for you.&rsquo; He was mounting his horse as he
      spoke. &lsquo;Write something in my sister&rsquo;s album for me,&rsquo; I said rather
      timidly, for he was in a state of great dejection at the moment. He
      turned, called for a pen, took the album. &lsquo;How old is your sister?&rsquo; he
      asked, holding the pen in his hand. &lsquo;Three years old,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;Ah, <i>petite
      fille alors!</i>&rsquo; and he wrote in the album:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ne mentez jamais! <span class="sc">Napoléon</span> (votre ami sincère).&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such advice, and at such a moment, you must allow, prince, was&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, quite so; very remarkable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This page of the album, framed in gold, hung on the wall of my sister&rsquo;s
      drawing-room all her life, in the most conspicuous place, till the day of
      her death; where it is now, I really don&rsquo;t know. Heavens! it&rsquo;s two
      o&rsquo;clock! <i>How</i> I have kept you, prince! It is really most
      unpardonable of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The general rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not in the least,&rdquo; said the prince. &ldquo;On the contrary, I have been so
      much interested, I&rsquo;m really very much obliged to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prince,&rdquo; said the general, pressing his hand, and looking at him with
      flashing eyes, and an expression as though he were under the influence of
      a sudden thought which had come upon him with stunning force. &ldquo;Prince, you
      are so kind, so simple-minded, that sometimes I really feel sorry for you!
      I gaze at you with a feeling of real affection. Oh, Heaven bless you! May
      your life blossom and fructify in love. Mine is over. Forgive me, forgive
      me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He left the room quickly, covering his face with his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince could not doubt the sincerity of his agitation. He understood,
      too, that the old man had left the room intoxicated with his own success.
      The general belonged to that class of liars, who, in spite of their
      transports of lying, invariably suspect that they are not believed. On
      this occasion, when he recovered from his exaltation, he would probably
      suspect Muishkin of pitying him, and feel insulted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I been acting rightly in allowing him to develop such vast resources
      of imagination?&rdquo; the prince asked himself. But his answer was a fit of
      violent laughter which lasted ten whole minutes. He tried to reproach
      himself for the laughing fit, but eventually concluded that he needn&rsquo;t do
      so, since in spite of it he was truly sorry for the old man. The same
      evening he received a strange letter, short but decided. The general
      informed him that they must part for ever; that he was grateful, but that
      even from him he could not accept &ldquo;signs of sympathy which were
      humiliating to the dignity of a man already miserable enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the prince heard that the old man had gone to Nina Alexandrovna,
      though, he felt almost easy on his account.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have seen, however, that the general paid a visit to Lizabetha
      Prokofievna and caused trouble there, the final upshot being that he
      frightened Mrs. Epanchin, and angered her by bitter hints as to his son
      Gania.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been turned out in disgrace, eventually, and this was the cause of
      his bad night and quarrelsome day, which ended in his sudden departure
      into the street in a condition approaching insanity, as recorded before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colia did not understand the position. He tried severity with his father,
      as they stood in the street after the latter had cursed the household,
      hoping to bring him round that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, where are we to go to now, father?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to go
      to the prince&rsquo;s; you have quarrelled with Lebedeff; you have no money; I
      never have any; and here we are in the middle of the road, in a nice sort
      of mess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better to be of a mess than in a mess! I remember making a joke something
      like that at the mess in eighteen hundred and forty&mdash;forty&mdash;I
      forget. &lsquo;Where is my youth, where is my golden youth?&rsquo; Who was it said
      that, Colia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was Gogol, in Dead Souls, father,&rdquo; cried Colia, glancing at him in
      some alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Dead Souls,&rsquo; yes, of course, dead. When I die, Colia, you must engrave
      on my tomb:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;&lsquo;Here lies a Dead Soul,
    Shame pursues me.&rsquo;
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who said that, Colia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was no Eropegoff? Eroshka Eropegoff?&rdquo; he cried, suddenly, stopping
      in the road in a frenzy. &ldquo;No Eropegoff! And my own son to say it!
      Eropegoff was in the place of a brother to me for eleven months. I fought
      a duel for him. He was married afterwards, and then killed on the field of
      battle. The bullet struck the cross on my breast and glanced off straight
      into his temple. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll never forget you,&rsquo; he cried, and expired. I served
      my country well and honestly, Colia, but shame, shame has pursued me! You
      and Nina will come to my grave, Colia; poor Nina, I always used to call
      her Nina in the old days, and how she loved.... Nina, Nina, oh, Nina. What
      have I ever done to deserve your forgiveness and long-suffering? Oh,
      Colia, your mother has an angelic spirit, an angelic spirit, Colia!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that, father. Look here, dear old father, come back home! Let&rsquo;s go
      back to mother. Look, she ran after us when we came out. What have you
      stopped her for, just as though you didn&rsquo;t take in what I said? Why are
      you crying, father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor Colia cried himself, and kissed the old man&rsquo;s hands
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You kiss my hands, <i>mine?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, yours, yours! What is there to surprise anyone in that? Come,
      come, you mustn&rsquo;t go on like this, crying in the middle of the road; and
      you a general too, a military man! Come, let&rsquo;s go back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless you, dear boy, for being respectful to a disgraced man. Yes, to
      a poor disgraced old fellow, your father. You shall have such a son
      yourself; le roi de Rome. Oh, curses on this house!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, what does all this mean?&rdquo; cried Colia beside himself at last.
      &ldquo;What is it? What has happened to you? Why don&rsquo;t you wish to come back
      home? Why have you gone out of your mind, like this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll explain it, I&rsquo;ll explain all to you. Don&rsquo;t shout! You shall hear. Le
      roi de Rome. Oh, I am sad, I am melancholy!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Nurse, where is your tomb?&rsquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who said that, Colia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I don&rsquo;t know who said it. Come home at once; come on! I&rsquo;ll
      punch Gania&rsquo;s head myself, if you like&mdash;only come. Oh, where <i>are</i>
      you off to again?&rdquo; The general was dragging him away towards the door of a
      house nearby. He sat down on the step, still holding Colia by the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bend down&mdash;bend down your ear. I&rsquo;ll tell you all&mdash;disgrace&mdash;bend
      down, I&rsquo;ll tell you in your ear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you dreaming of?&rdquo; said poor, frightened Colia, stooping down
      towards the old man, all the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Le roi de Rome,&rdquo; whispered the general, trembling all over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? What <i>do</i> you mean? What roi de Rome?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I,&rdquo; the general continued to whisper, clinging more and more
      tightly to the boy&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;I&mdash;wish&mdash;to tell you&mdash;all&mdash;Maria&mdash;Maria
      Petrovna&mdash;Su&mdash;Su&mdash;Su.......&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colia broke loose, seized his father by the shoulders, and stared into his
      eyes with frenzied gaze. The old man had grown livid&mdash;his lips were
      shaking, convulsions were passing over his features. Suddenly he leant
      over and began to sink slowly into Colia&rsquo;s arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got a stroke!&rdquo; cried Colia, loudly, realizing what was the matter at
      last.
    </p>
    <h3>
      V.
    </h3>
    <p>
      In point of fact, Varia had rather exaggerated the certainty of her news
      as to the prince&rsquo;s betrothal to Aglaya. Very likely, with the perspicacity
      of her sex, she gave out as an accomplished fact what she felt was pretty
      sure to become a fact in a few days. Perhaps she could not resist the
      satisfaction of pouring one last drop of bitterness into her brother
      Gania&rsquo;s cup, in spite of her love for him. At all events, she had been
      unable to obtain any definite news from the Epanchin girls&mdash;the most
      she could get out of them being hints and surmises, and so on. Perhaps
      Aglaya&rsquo;s sisters had merely been pumping Varia for news while pretending
      to impart information; or perhaps, again, they had been unable to resist
      the feminine gratification of teasing a friend&mdash;for, after all this
      time, they could scarcely have helped divining the aim of her frequent
      visits.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, the prince, although he had told Lebedeff,&mdash;as we
      know, that nothing had happened, and that he had nothing to impart,&mdash;the
      prince may have been in error. Something strange seemed to have happened,
      without anything definite having actually happened. Varia had guessed that
      with her true feminine instinct.
    </p>
    <p>
      How or why it came about that everyone at the Epanchins&rsquo; became imbued
      with one conviction&mdash;that something very important had happened to
      Aglaya, and that her fate was in process of settlement&mdash;it would be
      very difficult to explain. But no sooner had this idea taken root, than
      all at once declared that they had seen and observed it long ago; that
      they had remarked it at the time of the &ldquo;poor knight&rdquo; joke, and even
      before, though they had been unwilling to believe in such nonsense.
    </p>
    <p>
      So said the sisters. Of course, Lizabetha Prokofievna had foreseen it long
      before the rest; her &ldquo;heart had been sore&rdquo; for a long while, she declared,
      and it was now so sore that she appeared to be quite overwhelmed, and the
      very thought of the prince became distasteful to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a question to be decided&mdash;most important, but most
      difficult; so much so, that Mrs. Epanchin did not even see how to put it
      into words. Would the prince do or not? Was all this good or bad? If good
      (which might be the case, of course), <i>why</i> good? If bad (which was
      hardly doubtful), <i>wherein</i>, especially, bad? Even the general, the
      paterfamilias, though astonished at first, suddenly declared that, &ldquo;upon
      his honour, he really believed he had fancied something of the kind, after
      all. At first, it seemed a new idea, and then, somehow, it looked as
      familiar as possible.&rdquo; His wife frowned him down there. This was in the
      morning; but in the evening, alone with his wife, he had given tongue
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, really, you know&rdquo;&mdash;(silence)&mdash;&ldquo;of course, you know all
      this is very strange, if true, which I cannot deny; but&rdquo;&mdash;(silence).&mdash;&ldquo;But,
      on the other hand, if one looks things in the face, you know&mdash;upon my
      honour, the prince is a rare good fellow&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;well,
      his name, you know&mdash;your family name&mdash;all this looks well, and
      perpetuates the name and title and all that&mdash;which at this moment is
      not standing so high as it might&mdash;from one point of view&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      you know? The world, the world is the world, of course&mdash;and people
      will talk&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;the prince has property, you know&mdash;if
      it is not very large&mdash;and then he&mdash;he&mdash;&rdquo; (Continued
      silence, and collapse of the general.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Hearing these words from her husband, Lizabetha Prokofievna was driven
      beside herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to her opinion, the whole thing had been one huge, fantastical,
      absurd, unpardonable mistake. &ldquo;First of all, this prince is an idiot, and,
      secondly, he is a fool&mdash;knows nothing of the world, and has no place
      in it. Whom can he be shown to? Where can you take him to? What will old
      Bielokonski say? We never thought of such a husband as <i>that</i> for our
      Aglaya!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of course, the last argument was the chief one. The maternal heart
      trembled with indignation to think of such an absurdity, although in that
      heart there rose another voice, which said: &ldquo;And <i>why</i> is not the
      prince such a husband as you would have desired for Aglaya?&rdquo; It was this
      voice which annoyed Lizabetha Prokofievna more than anything else.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some reason or other, the sisters liked the idea of the prince. They
      did not even consider it very strange; in a word, they might be expected
      at any moment to range themselves strongly on his side. But both of them
      decided to say nothing either way. It had always been noticed in the
      family that the stronger Mrs. Epanchin&rsquo;s opposition was to any project,
      the nearer she was, in reality, to giving in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alexandra, however, found it difficult to keep absolute silence on the
      subject. Long since holding, as she did, the post of &ldquo;confidential adviser
      to mamma,&rdquo; she was now perpetually called in council, and asked her
      opinion, and especially her assistance, in order to recollect &ldquo;how on
      earth all this happened?&rdquo; Why did no one see it? Why did no one say
      anything about it? What did all that wretched &ldquo;poor knight&rdquo; joke mean? Why
      was she, Lizabetha Prokofievna, driven to think, and foresee, and worry
      for everybody, while they all sucked their thumbs, and counted the crows
      in the garden, and did nothing? At first, Alexandra had been very careful,
      and had merely replied that perhaps her father&rsquo;s remark was not so far
      out: that, in the eyes of the world, probably the choice of the prince as
      a husband for one of the Epanchin girls would be considered a very wise
      one. Warming up, however, she added that the prince was by no means a
      fool, and never had been; and that as to &ldquo;place in the world,&rdquo; no one knew
      what the position of a respectable person in Russia would imply in a few
      years&mdash;whether it would depend on successes in the government
      service, on the old system, or what.
    </p>
    <p>
      To all this her mother replied that Alexandra was a freethinker, and that
      all this was due to that &ldquo;cursed woman&rsquo;s rights question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour after this conversation, she went off to town, and thence to
      the Kammenny Ostrof, [&ldquo;Stone Island,&rdquo; a suburb and park of St. Petersburg]
      to see Princess Bielokonski, who had just arrived from Moscow on a short
      visit. The princess was Aglaya&rsquo;s godmother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old Bielokonski&rdquo; listened to all the fevered and despairing lamentations
      of Lizabetha Prokofievna without the least emotion; the tears of this
      sorrowful mother did not evoke answering sighs&mdash;in fact, she laughed
      at her. She was a dreadful old despot, this princess; she could not allow
      equality in anything, not even in friendship of the oldest standing, and
      she insisted on treating Mrs. Epanchin as her <i>protégée</i>, as she had
      been thirty-five years ago. She could never put up with the independence
      and energy of Lizabetha&rsquo;s character. She observed that, as usual, the
      whole family had gone much too far ahead, and had converted a fly into an
      elephant; that, so far as she had heard their story, she was persuaded
      that nothing of any seriousness had occurred; that it would surely be
      better to wait until something <i>did</i> happen; that the prince, in her
      opinion, was a very decent young fellow, though perhaps a little
      eccentric, through illness, and not quite as weighty in the world as one
      could wish. The worst feature was, she said, Nastasia Philipovna.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lizabetha Prokofievna well understood that the old lady was angry at the
      failure of Evgenie Pavlovitch&mdash;her own recommendation. She returned
      home to Pavlofsk in a worse humour than when she left, and of course
      everybody in the house suffered. She pitched into everyone, because, she
      declared, they had &lsquo;gone mad.&rsquo; Why were things always mismanaged in her
      house? Why had everybody been in such a frantic hurry in this matter? So
      far as she could see, nothing whatever had happened. Surely they had
      better wait and see what was to happen, instead of making mountains out of
      molehills.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so the conclusion of the matter was that it would be far better to
      take it quietly, and wait coolly to see what would turn up. But, alas!
      peace did not reign for more than ten minutes. The first blow dealt to its
      power was in certain news communicated to Lizabetha Prokofievna as to
      events which had happened during her trip to see the princess. (This trip
      had taken place the day after that on which the prince had turned up at
      the Epanchins at nearly one o&rsquo;clock at night, thinking it was nine.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The sisters replied candidly and fully enough to their mother&rsquo;s impatient
      questions on her return. They said, in the first place, that nothing
      particular had happened since her departure; that the prince had been, and
      that Aglaya had kept him waiting a long while before she appeared&mdash;half
      an hour, at least; that she had then come in, and immediately asked the
      prince to have a game of chess; that the prince did not know the game, and
      Aglaya had beaten him easily; that she had been in a wonderfully merry
      mood, and had laughed at the prince, and chaffed him so unmercifully that
      one was quite sorry to see his wretched expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had then asked him to play cards&mdash;the game called &ldquo;little fools.&rdquo;
       At this game the tables were turned completely, for the prince had shown
      himself a master at it. Aglaya had cheated and changed cards, and stolen
      others, in the most bare-faced way, but, in spite of everything the prince
      had beaten her hopelessly five times running, and she had been left
      &ldquo;little fool&rdquo; each time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aglaya then lost her temper, and began to say such awful things to the
      prince that he laughed no more, but grew dreadfully pale, especially when
      she said that she should not remain in the house with him, and that he
      ought to be ashamed of coming to their house at all, especially at night,
      &ldquo;<i>after all that had happened</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, she had left the room, banging the door after her, and the
      prince went off, looking as though he were on his way to a funeral, in
      spite of all their attempts at consolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, a quarter of an hour after the prince&rsquo;s departure, Aglaya had
      rushed out of her room in such a hurry that she had not even wiped her
      eyes, which were full of tears. She came back because Colia had brought a
      hedgehog. Everybody came in to see the hedgehog. In answer to their
      questions Colia explained that the hedgehog was not his, and that he had
      left another boy, Kostia Lebedeff, waiting for him outside. Kostia was too
      shy to come in, because he was carrying a hatchet; they had bought the
      hedgehog and the hatchet from a peasant whom they had met on the road. He
      had offered to sell them the hedgehog, and they had paid fifty copecks for
      it; and the hatchet had so taken their fancy that they had made up their
      minds to buy it of their own accord. On hearing this, Aglaya urged Colia
      to sell her the hedgehog; she even called him &ldquo;dear Colia,&rdquo; in trying to
      coax him. He refused for a long time, but at last he could hold out no
      more, and went to fetch Kostia Lebedeff. The latter appeared, carrying his
      hatchet, and covered with confusion. Then it came out that the hedgehog
      was not theirs, but the property of a schoolmate, one Petroff, who had
      given them some money to buy Schlosser&rsquo;s History for him, from another
      schoolfellow who at that moment was driven to raising money by the sale of
      his books. Colia and Kostia were about to make this purchase for their
      friend when chance brought the hedgehog to their notice, and they had
      succumbed to the temptation of buying it. They were now taking Petroff the
      hedgehog and hatchet which they had bought with his money, instead of
      Schlosser&rsquo;s History. But Aglaya so entreated them that at last they
      consented to sell her the hedgehog. As soon as she had got possession of
      it, she put it in a wicker basket with Colia&rsquo;s help, and covered it with a
      napkin. Then she said to Colia: &ldquo;Go and take this hedgehog to the prince
      from me, and ask him to accept it as a token of my profound respect.&rdquo;
       Colia joyfully promised to do the errand, but he demanded explanations.
      &ldquo;What does the hedgehog mean? What is the meaning of such a present?&rdquo;
       Aglaya replied that it was none of his business. &ldquo;I am sure that there is
      some allegory about it,&rdquo; Colia persisted. Aglaya grew angry, and called
      him &ldquo;a silly boy.&rdquo; &ldquo;If I did not respect all women in your person,&rdquo;
       replied Colia, &ldquo;and if my own principles would permit it, I would soon
      prove to you, that I know how to answer such an insult!&rdquo; But, in the end,
      Colia went off with the hedgehog in great delight, followed by Kostia
      Lebedeff. Aglaya&rsquo;s annoyance was soon over, and seeing that Colia was
      swinging the hedgehog&rsquo;s basket violently to and fro, she called out to him
      from the verandah, as if they had never quarrelled: &ldquo;Colia, dear, please
      take care not to drop him!&rdquo; Colia appeared to have no grudge against her,
      either, for he stopped, and answered most cordially: &ldquo;No, I will not drop
      him! Don&rsquo;t be afraid, Aglaya Ivanovna!&rdquo; After which he went on his way.
      Aglaya burst out laughing and ran up to her room, highly delighted. Her
      good spirits lasted the whole day.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this filled poor Lizabetha&rsquo;s mind with chaotic confusion. What on
      earth did it all mean? The most disturbing feature was the hedgehog. What
      was the symbolic signification of a hedgehog? What did they understand by
      it? What underlay it? Was it a cryptic message?
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor General Epanchin &ldquo;put his foot in it&rdquo; by answering the above
      questions in his own way. He said there was no cryptic message at all. As
      for the hedgehog, it was just a hedgehog, which meant nothing&mdash;unless,
      indeed, it was a pledge of friendship,&mdash;the sign of forgetting of
      offences and so on. At all events, it was a joke, and, of course, a most
      pardonable and innocent one.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may as well remark that the general had guessed perfectly accurately.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince, returning home from the interview with Aglaya, had sat gloomy
      and depressed for half an hour. He was almost in despair when Colia
      arrived with the hedgehog.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the sky cleared in a moment. The prince seemed to arise from the
      dead; he asked Colia all about it, made him repeat the story over and over
      again, and laughed and shook hands with the boys in his delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed clear to the prince that Aglaya forgave him, and that he might
      go there again this very evening; and in his eyes that was not only the
      main thing, but everything in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What children we are still, Colia!&rdquo; he cried at last, enthusiastically,&mdash;&ldquo;and
      how delightful it is that we can be children still!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Simply&mdash;my dear prince,&mdash;simply she is in love with you,&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      the whole of the secret!&rdquo; replied Colia, with authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince blushed, but this time he said nothing. Colia burst out
      laughing and clapped his hands. A minute later the prince laughed too, and
      from this moment until the evening he looked at his watch every other
      minute to see how much time he had to wait before evening came.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the situation was becoming rapidly critical.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Epanchin could bear her suspense no longer, and in spite of the
      opposition of husband and daughters, she sent for Aglaya, determined to
      get a straightforward answer out of her, once for all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Otherwise,&rdquo; she observed hysterically, &ldquo;I shall die before evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was only now that everyone realized to what a ridiculous dead-lock the
      whole matter had been brought. Excepting feigned surprise, indignation,
      laughter, and jeering&mdash;both at the prince and at everyone who asked
      her questions,&mdash;nothing could be got out of Aglaya.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lizabetha Prokofievna went to bed and only rose again in time for tea,
      when the prince might be expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      She awaited him in trembling agitation; and when he at last arrived she
      nearly went off into hysterics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Muishkin himself came in very timidly. He seemed to feel his way, and
      looked in each person&rsquo;s eyes in a questioning way,&mdash;for Aglaya was
      absent, which fact alarmed him at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      This evening there were no strangers present&mdash;no one but the
      immediate members of the family. Prince S. was still in town, occupied
      with the affairs of Evgenie Pavlovitch&rsquo;s uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish at least <i>he</i> would come and say something!&rdquo; complained poor
      Lizabetha Prokofievna.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general sat still with a most preoccupied air. The sisters were
      looking very serious and did not speak a word, and Lizabetha Prokofievna
      did not know how to commence the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length she plunged into an energetic and hostile criticism of railways,
      and glared at the prince defiantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas Aglaya still did not come&mdash;and the prince was quite lost. He had
      the greatest difficulty in expressing his opinion that railways were most
      useful institutions,&mdash;and in the middle of his speech Adelaida
      laughed, which threw him into a still worse state of confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment in marched Aglaya, as calm and collected as could be. She
      gave the prince a ceremonious bow and solemnly took up a prominent
      position near the big round table. She looked at the prince questioningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      All present realized that the moment for the settlement of perplexities
      had arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you get my hedgehog?&rdquo; she inquired, firmly and almost angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I got it,&rdquo; said the prince, blushing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell us now, at once, what you made of the present? I must have you
      answer this question for mother&rsquo;s sake; she needs pacifying, and so do all
      the rest of the family!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Aglaya&mdash;&rdquo; began the general.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This&mdash;this is going beyond all limits!&rdquo; said Lizabetha Prokofievna,
      suddenly alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not in the least beyond all limits, mamma!&rdquo; said her daughter,
      firmly. &ldquo;I sent the prince a hedgehog this morning, and I wish to hear his
      opinion of it. Go on, prince.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&mdash;what sort of opinion, Aglaya Ivanovna?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About the hedgehog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is&mdash;I suppose you wish to know how I received the hedgehog,
      Aglaya Ivanovna,&mdash;or, I should say, how I regarded your sending him
      to me? In that case, I may tell you&mdash;in a word&mdash;that I&mdash;in
      fact&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, breathless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come&mdash;you haven&rsquo;t told us much!&rdquo; said Aglaya, after waiting some
      five seconds. &ldquo;Very well, I am ready to drop the hedgehog, if you like;
      but I am anxious to be able to clear up this accumulation of
      misunderstandings. Allow me to ask you, prince,&mdash;I wish to hear from
      you, personally&mdash;are you making me an offer, or not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gracious heavens!&rdquo; exclaimed Lizabetha Prokofievna. The prince started.
      The general stiffened in his chair; the sisters frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t deceive me now, prince&mdash;tell the truth. All these people
      persecute me with astounding questions&mdash;about you. Is there any
      ground for all these questions, or not? Come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not asked you to marry me yet, Aglaya Ivanovna,&rdquo; said the prince,
      becoming suddenly animated; &ldquo;but you know yourself how much I love you and
      trust you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;I asked you this&mdash;answer this! Do you intend to ask for my
      hand, or not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I do ask for it!&rdquo; said the prince, more dead than alive now.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a general stir in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;no&mdash;my dear girl,&rdquo; began the general. &ldquo;You cannot proceed
      like this, Aglaya, if that&rsquo;s how the matter stands. It&rsquo;s impossible.
      Prince, forgive it, my dear fellow, but&mdash;Lizabetha Prokofievna!&rdquo;&mdash;he
      appealed to his spouse for help&mdash;&ldquo;you must really&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I&mdash;not I! I retire from all responsibility,&rdquo; said Lizabetha
      Prokofievna, with a wave of the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allow me to speak, please, mamma,&rdquo; said Aglaya. &ldquo;I think I ought to have
      something to say in the matter. An important moment of my destiny is about
      to be decided&rdquo;&mdash;(this is how Aglaya expressed herself)&mdash;&ldquo;and I
      wish to find out how the matter stands, for my own sake, though I am glad
      you are all here. Allow me to ask you, prince, since you cherish those
      intentions, how you consider that you will provide for my happiness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t quite know how to answer your question, Aglaya Ivanovna.
      What is there to say to such a question? And&mdash;and must I answer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you are rather overwhelmed and out of breath. Have a little rest,
      and try to recover yourself. Take a glass of water, or&mdash;but they&rsquo;ll
      give you some tea directly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love you, Aglaya Ivanovna,&mdash;I love you very much. I love only you&mdash;and&mdash;please
      don&rsquo;t jest about it, for I do love you very much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, this matter is important. We are not children&mdash;we must look
      into it thoroughly. Now then, kindly tell me&mdash;what does your fortune
      consist of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;Aglaya&mdash;come, enough of this, you mustn&rsquo;t behave like
      this,&rdquo; said her father, in dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s disgraceful,&rdquo; said Lizabetha Prokofievna in a loud whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s mad&mdash;quite!&rdquo; said Alexandra.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fortune&mdash;money&mdash;do you mean?&rdquo; asked the prince in some
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have now&mdash;let&rsquo;s see&mdash;I have a hundred and thirty-five
      thousand roubles,&rdquo; said the prince, blushing violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all, really?&rdquo; said Aglaya, candidly, without the slightest show
      of confusion. &ldquo;However, it&rsquo;s not so bad, especially if managed with
      economy. Do you intend to serve?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I intended to try for a certificate as private tutor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good. That would increase our income nicely. Have you any intention
      of being a Kammer-junker?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Kammer-junker? I had not thought of it, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But here the two sisters could restrain themselves no longer, and both of
      them burst into irrepressible laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adelaida had long since detected in Aglaya&rsquo;s features the gathering signs
      of an approaching storm of laughter, which she restrained with amazing
      self-control.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aglaya looked menacingly at her laughing sisters, but could not contain
      herself any longer, and the next minute she too had burst into an
      irrepressible, and almost hysterical, fit of mirth. At length she jumped
      up, and ran out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew it was all a joke!&rdquo; cried Adelaida. &ldquo;I felt it ever since&mdash;since
      the hedgehog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! I cannot allow this,&mdash;this is a little too much,&rdquo; cried
      Lizabetha Prokofievna, exploding with rage, and she rose from her seat and
      followed Aglaya out of the room as quickly as she could.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two sisters hurriedly went after her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince and the general were the only two persons left in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s really&mdash;now could you have imagined anything like
      it, Lef Nicolaievitch?&rdquo; cried the general. He was evidently so much
      agitated that he hardly knew what he wished to say. &ldquo;Seriously now,
      seriously I mean&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only see that Aglaya Ivanovna is laughing at me,&rdquo; said the poor prince,
      sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a bit, my boy, I&rsquo;ll just go&mdash;you stay here, you know. But do
      just explain, if you can, Lef Nicolaievitch, how in the world has all this
      come about? And what does it all mean? You must understand, my dear
      fellow; I am a father, you see, and I ought to be allowed to understand
      the matter&mdash;do explain, I beg you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love Aglaya Ivanovna&mdash;she knows it,&mdash;and I think she must
      have long known it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The general shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strange&mdash;it&rsquo;s strange,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and you love her very much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, very much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;it&rsquo;s all most strange to me. That is&mdash;my dear fellow, it
      is such a surprise&mdash;such a blow&mdash;that... You see, it is not your
      financial position (though I should not object if you were a bit richer)&mdash;I
      am thinking of my daughter&rsquo;s happiness, of course, and the thing is&mdash;are
      you able to give her the happiness she deserves? And then&mdash;is all
      this a joke on her part, or is she in earnest? I don&rsquo;t mean on your side,
      but on hers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Alexandra&rsquo;s voice was heard outside the door, calling out
      &ldquo;Papa!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait for me here, my boy&mdash;will you? Just wait and think it all over,
      and I&rsquo;ll come back directly,&rdquo; he said hurriedly, and made off with what
      looked like the rapidity of alarm in response to Alexandra&rsquo;s call.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found the mother and daughter locked in one another&rsquo;s arms, mingling
      their tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were the tears of joy and peace and reconciliation. Aglaya was
      kissing her mother&rsquo;s lips and cheeks and hands; they were hugging each
      other in the most ardent way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, look at her now&mdash;Ivan Fedorovitch! Here she is&mdash;all of
      her! This is our <i>real</i> Aglaya at last!&rdquo; said Lizabetha Prokofievna.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aglaya raised her happy, tearful face from her mother&rsquo;s breast, glanced at
      her father, and burst out laughing. She sprang at him and hugged him too,
      and kissed him over and over again. She then rushed back to her mother and
      hid her face in the maternal bosom, and there indulged in more tears. Her
      mother covered her with a corner of her shawl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you cruel little girl! How will you treat us all next, I wonder?&rdquo; she
      said, but she spoke with a ring of joy in her voice, and as though she
      breathed at last without the oppression which she had felt so long.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cruel?&rdquo; sobbed Aglaya. &ldquo;Yes, I <i>am</i> cruel, and worthless, and
      spoiled&mdash;tell father so,&mdash;oh, here he is&mdash;I forgot Father,
      listen!&rdquo; She laughed through her tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My darling, my little idol,&rdquo; cried the general, kissing and fondling her
      hands (Aglaya did not draw them away); &ldquo;so you love this young man, do
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, no, can&rsquo;t <i>bear</i> him, I can&rsquo;t <i>bear</i> your young man!&rdquo;
       cried Aglaya, raising her head. &ldquo;And if you dare say that <i>once</i>
      more, papa&mdash;I&rsquo;m serious, you know, I&rsquo;m,&mdash;do you hear me&mdash;I&rsquo;m
      serious!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She certainly did seem to be serious enough. She had flushed up all over
      and her eyes were blazing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general felt troubled and remained silent, while Lizabetha Prokofievna
      telegraphed to him from behind Aglaya to ask no questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, darling&mdash;then, of course, you shall do exactly
      as you like. He is waiting alone downstairs. Hadn&rsquo;t I better hint to him
      gently that he can go?&rdquo; The general telegraphed to Lizabetha Prokofievna
      in his turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, you needn&rsquo;t do anything of the sort; you mustn&rsquo;t hint gently at
      all. I&rsquo;ll go down myself directly. I wish to apologize to this young man,
      because I hurt his feelings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, <i>seriously</i>,&rdquo; said the general, gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;d better stay here, all of you, for a little, and I&rsquo;ll go down
      to him alone to begin with. I&rsquo;ll just go in and then you can follow me
      almost at once. That&rsquo;s the best way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had almost reached the door when she turned round again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall laugh&mdash;I know I shall; I shall die of laughing,&rdquo; she said,
      lugubriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, she turned and ran down to the prince as fast as her feet could
      carry her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what does it all mean? What do you make of it?&rdquo; asked the general
      of his spouse, hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hardly dare say,&rdquo; said Lizabetha, as hurriedly, &ldquo;but I think it&rsquo;s as
      plain as anything can be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so too, as clear as day; she loves him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Loves him? She is head over ears in love, that&rsquo;s what she is,&rdquo; put in
      Alexandra.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, God bless her, God bless her, if such is her destiny,&rdquo; said
      Lizabetha, crossing herself devoutly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m destiny it is,&rdquo; said the general, &ldquo;and there&rsquo;s no getting out of
      destiny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words they all moved off towards the drawing-room, where
      another surprise awaited them. Aglaya had not only not laughed, as she had
      feared, but had gone to the prince rather timidly, and said to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive a silly, horrid, spoilt girl&rdquo;&mdash;(she took his hand here)&mdash;&ldquo;and
      be quite assured that we all of us esteem you beyond all words. And if I
      dared to turn your beautiful, admirable simplicity to ridicule, forgive me
      as you would a little child its mischief. Forgive me all my absurdity of
      just now, which, of course, meant nothing, and could not have the
      slightest consequence.&rdquo; She spoke these words with great emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father, mother, and sisters came into the room and were much struck
      with the last words, which they just caught as they entered&mdash;&ldquo;absurdity
      which of course meant nothing&rdquo;&mdash;and still more so with the emphasis
      with which Aglaya had spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      They exchanged glances questioningly, but the prince did not seem to have
      understood the meaning of Aglaya&rsquo;s words; he was in the highest heaven of
      delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you speak so?&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Why do you ask my forgiveness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He wished to add that he was unworthy of being asked for forgiveness by
      her, but paused. Perhaps he did understand Aglaya&rsquo;s sentence about
      &ldquo;absurdity which meant nothing,&rdquo; and like the strange fellow that he was,
      rejoiced in the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Undoubtedly the fact that he might now come and see Aglaya as much as he
      pleased again was quite enough to make him perfectly happy; that he might
      come and speak to her, and see her, and sit by her, and walk with her&mdash;who
      knows, but that all this was quite enough to satisfy him for the whole of
      his life, and that he would desire no more to the end of time?
    </p>
    <p>
      (Lizabetha Prokofievna felt that this might be the case, and she didn&rsquo;t
      like it; though very probably she could not have put the idea into words.)
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be difficult to describe the animation and high spirits which
      distinguished the prince for the rest of the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was so happy that &ldquo;it made one feel happy to look at him,&rdquo; as Aglaya&rsquo;s
      sisters expressed it afterwards. He talked, and told stories just as he
      had done once before, and never since, namely on the very first morning of
      his acquaintance with the Epanchins, six months ago. Since his return to
      Petersburg from Moscow, he had been remarkably silent, and had told Prince
      S. on one occasion, before everyone, that he did not think himself
      justified in degrading any thought by his unworthy words.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this evening he did nearly all the talking himself, and told stories
      by the dozen, while he answered all questions put to him clearly, gladly,
      and with any amount of detail.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing, however, of love-making in his talk. His ideas were all
      of the most serious kind; some were even mystical and profound.
    </p>
    <p>
      He aired his own views on various matters, some of his most private
      opinions and observations, many of which would have seemed rather funny,
      so his hearers agreed afterwards, had they not been so well expressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general liked serious subjects of conversation; but both he and
      Lizabetha Prokofievna felt that they were having a little too much of a
      good thing tonight, and as the evening advanced, they both grew more or
      less melancholy; but towards night, the prince fell to telling funny
      stories, and was always the first to burst out laughing himself, which he
      invariably did so joyously and simply that the rest laughed just as much
      at him as at his stories.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Aglaya, she hardly said a word all the evening; but she listened
      with all her ears to Lef Nicolaievitch&rsquo;s talk, and scarcely took her eyes
      off him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She looked at him, and stared and stared, and hung on every word he
      said,&rdquo; said Lizabetha afterwards, to her husband, &ldquo;and yet, tell her that
      she loves him, and she is furious!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s to be done? It&rsquo;s fate,&rdquo; said the general, shrugging his shoulders,
      and, for a long while after, he continued to repeat: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fate, it&rsquo;s
      fate!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We may add that to a business man like General Epanchin the present
      position of affairs was most unsatisfactory. He hated the uncertainty in
      which they had been, perforce, left. However, he decided to say no more
      about it, and merely to look on, and take his time and tune from Lizabetha
      Prokofievna.
    </p>
    <p>
      The happy state in which the family had spent the evening, as just
      recorded, was not of very long duration. Next day Aglaya quarrelled with
      the prince again, and so she continued to behave for the next few days.
      For whole hours at a time she ridiculed and chaffed the wretched man, and
      made him almost a laughing-stock.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is true that they used to sit in the little summer-house together for
      an hour or two at a time, very often, but it was observed that on these
      occasions the prince would read the paper, or some book, aloud to Aglaya.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; Aglaya said to him once, interrupting the reading, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      remarked that you are dreadfully badly educated. You never know anything
      thoroughly, if one asks you; neither anyone&rsquo;s name, nor dates, nor about
      treaties and so on. It&rsquo;s a great pity, you know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you I had not had much of an education,&rdquo; replied the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How am I to respect you, if that&rsquo;s the case? Read on now. No&mdash;don&rsquo;t!
      Stop reading!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And once more, that same evening, Aglaya mystified them all. Prince S. had
      returned, and Aglaya was particularly amiable to him, and asked a great
      deal after Evgenie Pavlovitch. (Muishkin had not come in as yet.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Prince S. hinted something about &ldquo;a new and approaching change in
      the family.&rdquo; He was led to this remark by a communication inadvertently
      made to him by Lizabetha Prokofievna, that Adelaida&rsquo;s marriage must be
      postponed a little longer, in order that the two weddings might come off
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is impossible to describe Aglaya&rsquo;s irritation. She flared up, and said
      some indignant words about &ldquo;all these silly insinuations.&rdquo; She added that
      &ldquo;she had no intentions as yet of replacing anybody&rsquo;s mistress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words painfully impressed the whole party; but especially her
      parents. Lizabetha Prokofievna summoned a secret council of two, and
      insisted upon the general&rsquo;s demanding from the prince a full explanation
      of his relations with Nastasia Philipovna. The general argued that it was
      only a whim of Aglaya&rsquo;s; and that, had not Prince S. unfortunately made
      that remark, which had confused the child and made her blush, she never
      would have said what she did; and that he was sure Aglaya knew well that
      anything she might have heard of the prince and Nastasia Philipovna was
      merely the fabrication of malicious tongues, and that the woman was going
      to marry Rogojin. He insisted that the prince had nothing whatever to do
      with Nastasia Philipovna, so far as any liaison was concerned; and, if the
      truth were to be told about it, he added, never had had.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile nothing put the prince out, and he continued to be in the
      seventh heaven of bliss. Of course he could not fail to observe some
      impatience and ill-temper in Aglaya now and then; but he believed in
      something else, and nothing could now shake his conviction. Besides,
      Aglaya&rsquo;s frowns never lasted long; they disappeared of themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps he was too easy in his mind. So thought Hippolyte, at all events,
      who met him in the park one day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you the truth now, when I said you were in love?&rdquo; he said,
      coming up to Muishkin of his own accord, and stopping him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince gave him his hand and congratulated him upon &ldquo;looking so well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hippolyte himself seemed to be hopeful about his state of health, as is
      often the case with consumptives.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had approached the prince with the intention of talking sarcastically
      about his happy expression of face, but very soon forgot his intention and
      began to talk about himself. He began complaining about everything,
      disconnectedly and endlessly, as was his wont.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t believe,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;how irritating they all are there.
      They are such wretchedly small, vain, egotistical, <i>commonplace</i>
      people! Would you believe it, they invited me there under the express
      condition that I should die quickly, and they are all as wild as possible
      with me for not having died yet, and for being, on the contrary, a good
      deal better! Isn&rsquo;t it a comedy? I don&rsquo;t mind betting that you don&rsquo;t
      believe me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sometimes think of coming over to you again,&rdquo; said Hippolyte,
      carelessly. &ldquo;So you <i>don&rsquo;t</i> think them capable of inviting a man on
      the condition that he is to look sharp and die?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I certainly thought they invited you with quite other views.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho, ho! you are not nearly so simple as they try to make you out! This is
      not the time for it, or I would tell you a thing or two about that beauty,
      Gania, and his hopes. You are being undermined, pitilessly undermined, and&mdash;and
      it is really melancholy to see you so calm about it. But alas! it&rsquo;s your
      nature&mdash;you can&rsquo;t help it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My word! what a thing to be melancholy about! Why, do you think I should
      be any happier if I were to feel disturbed about the excavations you tell
      me of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is better to be unhappy and know the worst, than to be happy in a
      fool&rsquo;s paradise! I suppose you don&rsquo;t believe that you have a rival in that
      quarter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your insinuations as to rivalry are rather cynical, Hippolyte. I&rsquo;m sorry
      to say I have no right to answer you! As for Gania, I put it to you, <i>can</i>
      any man have a happy mind after passing through what he has had to suffer?
      I think that is the best way to look at it. He will change yet, he has
      lots of time before him, and life is rich; besides&mdash;besides...&rdquo; the
      prince hesitated. &ldquo;As to being undermined, I don&rsquo;t know what in the world
      you are driving at, Hippolyte. I think we had better drop the subject!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, we&rsquo;ll drop it for a while. You can&rsquo;t look at anything but in
      your exalted, generous way. You must put out your finger and touch a thing
      before you&rsquo;ll believe it, eh? Ha! ha! ha! I suppose you despise me
      dreadfully, prince, eh? What do you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? Because you have suffered more than we have?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; because I am unworthy of my sufferings, if you like!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whoever <i>can</i> suffer is worthy to suffer, I should think. Aglaya
      Ivanovna wished to see you, after she had read your confession, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She postponed the pleasure&mdash;I see&mdash;I quite understand!&rdquo; said
      Hippolyte, hurriedly, as though he wished to banish the subject. &ldquo;I hear&mdash;they
      tell me&mdash;that you read her all that nonsense aloud? Stupid bosh it
      was&mdash;written in delirium. And I can&rsquo;t understand how anyone can be so&mdash;I
      won&rsquo;t say <i>cruel</i>, because the word would be humiliating to myself,
      but we&rsquo;ll say childishly vain and revengeful, as to <i>reproach</i> me
      with this confession, and use it as a weapon against me. Don&rsquo;t be afraid,
      I&rsquo;m not referring to yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but I&rsquo;m sorry you repudiate the confession, Hippolyte&mdash;it is
      sincere; and, do you know, even the absurd parts of it&mdash;and these are
      many&rdquo; (here Hippolyte frowned savagely) &ldquo;are, as it were, redeemed by
      suffering&mdash;for it must have cost you something to admit what you
      there say&mdash;great torture, perhaps, for all I know. Your motive must
      have been a very noble one all through. Whatever may have appeared to the
      contrary, I give you my word, I see this more plainly every day. I do not
      judge you; I merely say this to have it off my mind, and I am only sorry
      that I did not say it all <i>then</i>&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hippolyte flushed hotly. He had thought at first that the prince was
      &ldquo;humbugging&rdquo; him; but on looking at his face he saw that he was absolutely
      serious, and had no thought of any deception. Hippolyte beamed with
      gratification.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet I must die,&rdquo; he said, and almost added: &ldquo;a man like me!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And imagine how that Gania annoys me! He has developed the idea&mdash;or
      pretends to believe&mdash;that in all probability three or four others who
      heard my confession will die before I do. There&rsquo;s an idea for you&mdash;and
      all this by way of <i>consoling</i> me! Ha! ha! ha! In the first place
      they haven&rsquo;t died yet; and in the second, if they <i>did</i> die&mdash;all
      of them&mdash;what would be the satisfaction to me in that? He judges me
      by himself. But he goes further, he actually pitches into me because, as
      he declares, &lsquo;any decent fellow&rsquo; would die quietly, and that &lsquo;all this&rsquo; is
      mere egotism on my part. He doesn&rsquo;t see what refinement of egotism it is
      on his own part&mdash;and at the same time, what ox-like coarseness! Have
      you ever read of the death of one Stepan Gleboff, in the eighteenth
      century? I read of it yesterday by chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was impaled on a stake in the time of Peter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, I know! He lay there fifteen hours in the hard frost, and died
      with the most extraordinary fortitude&mdash;I know&mdash;what of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only that God gives that sort of dying to some, and not to others.
      Perhaps you think, though, that I could not die like Gleboff?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all!&rdquo; said the prince, blushing. &ldquo;I was only going to say that you&mdash;not
      that you could not be like Gleboff&mdash;but that you would have been more
      like&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess what you mean&mdash;I should be an Osterman, not a Gleboff&mdash;eh?
      Is that what you meant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What Osterman?&rdquo; asked the prince in some surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Osterman&mdash;the diplomatist. Peter&rsquo;s Osterman,&rdquo; muttered
      Hippolyte, confused. There was a moment&rsquo;s pause of mutual confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, no!&rdquo; said the prince at last, &ldquo;that was not what I was going to
      say&mdash;oh no! I don&rsquo;t think you would ever have been like Osterman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hippolyte frowned gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you why I draw the conclusion,&rdquo; explained the prince, evidently
      desirous of clearing up the matter a little. &ldquo;Because, though I often
      think over the men of those times, I cannot for the life of me imagine
      them to be like ourselves. It really appears to me that they were of
      another race altogether than ourselves of today. At that time people
      seemed to stick so to one idea; now, they are more nervous, more
      sensitive, more enlightened&mdash;people of two or three ideas at once&mdash;as
      it were. The man of today is a broader man, so to speak&mdash;and I
      declare I believe that is what prevents him from being so self-contained
      and independent a being as his brother of those earlier days. Of course my
      remark was only made under this impression, and not in the least&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I quite understand. You are trying to comfort me for the naiveness with
      which you disagreed with me&mdash;eh? Ha! ha! ha! You are a regular child,
      prince! However, I cannot help seeing that you always treat me like&mdash;like
      a fragile china cup. Never mind, never mind, I&rsquo;m not a bit angry! At all
      events we have had a very funny talk. Do you know, all things considered,
      I should like to be something better than Osterman! I wouldn&rsquo;t take the
      trouble to rise from the dead to be an Osterman. However, I see I must
      make arrangements to die soon, or I myself&mdash;. Well&mdash;leave me
      now! <i>Au revoir.</i> Look here&mdash;before you go, just give me your
      opinion: how do you think I ought to die, now? I mean&mdash;the best, the
      most virtuous way? Tell me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should pass us by and forgive us our happiness,&rdquo; said the prince in a
      low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! ha! ha! I thought so. I thought I should hear something like that.
      Well, you are&mdash;you really are&mdash;oh dear me! Eloquence, eloquence!
      Good-bye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <h3>
      VI.
    </h3>
    <p>
      As to the evening party at the Epanchins&rsquo; at which Princess Bielokonski
      was to be present, Varia had reported with accuracy; though she had
      perhaps expressed herself too strongly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thing was decided in a hurry and with a certain amount of quite
      unnecessary excitement, doubtless because &ldquo;nothing could be done in this
      house like anywhere else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The impatience of Lizabetha Prokofievna &ldquo;to get things settled&rdquo; explained
      a good deal, as well as the anxiety of both parents for the happiness of
      their beloved daughter. Besides, Princess Bielokonski was going away soon,
      and they hoped that she would take an interest in the prince. They were
      anxious that he should enter society under the auspices of this lady,
      whose patronage was the best of recommendations for any young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even if there seems something strange about the match, the general and his
      wife said to each other, the &ldquo;world&rdquo; will accept Aglaya&rsquo;s fiance without
      any question if he is under the patronage of the princess. In any case,
      the prince would have to be &ldquo;shown&rdquo; sooner or later; that is, introduced
      into society, of which he had, so far, not the least idea. Moreover, it
      was only a question of a small gathering of a few intimate friends.
      Besides Princess Bielokonski, only one other lady was expected, the wife
      of a high dignitary. Evgenie Pavlovitch, who was to escort the princess,
      was the only young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Muishkin was told of the princess&rsquo;s visit three days beforehand, but
      nothing was said to him about the party until the night before it was to
      take place.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not help observing the excited and agitated condition of all
      members of the family, and from certain hints dropped in conversation he
      gathered that they were all anxious as to the impression he should make
      upon the princess. But the Epanchins, one and all, believed that Muishkin,
      in his simplicity of mind, was quite incapable of realizing that they
      could be feeling any anxiety on his account, and for this reason they all
      looked at him with dread and uneasiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      In point of fact, he did attach marvellously little importance to the
      approaching event. He was occupied with altogether different thoughts.
      Aglaya was growing hourly more capricious and gloomy, and this distressed
      him. When they told him that Evgenie Pavlovitch was expected, he evinced
      great delight, and said that he had long wished to see him&mdash;and
      somehow these words did not please anyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aglaya left the room in a fit of irritation, and it was not until late in
      the evening, past eleven, when the prince was taking his departure, that
      she said a word or two to him, privately, as she accompanied him as far as
      the front door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;not to come here tomorrow until evening,
      when the guests are all assembled. You know there are to be guests, don&rsquo;t
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spoke impatiently and with severity; this was the first allusion she
      had made to the party of tomorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      She hated the idea of it, everyone saw that; and she would probably have
      liked to quarrel about it with her parents, but pride and modesty
      prevented her from broaching the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince jumped to the conclusion that Aglaya, too, was nervous about
      him, and the impression he would make, and that she did not like to admit
      her anxiety; and this thought alarmed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am invited,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was evidently in difficulties as to how best to go on. &ldquo;May I speak of
      something serious to you, for once in my life?&rdquo; she asked, angrily. She
      was irritated at she knew not what, and could not restrain her wrath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you may; I am very glad to listen,&rdquo; replied Muishkin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aglaya was silent a moment and then began again with evident dislike of
      her subject:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not wish to quarrel with them about this; in some things they won&rsquo;t
      be reasonable. I always did feel a loathing for the laws which seem to
      guide mamma&rsquo;s conduct at times. I don&rsquo;t speak of father, for he cannot be
      expected to be anything but what he is. Mother is a noble-minded woman, I
      know; you try to suggest anything mean to her, and you&rsquo;ll see! But she is
      such a slave to these miserable creatures! I don&rsquo;t mean old Bielokonski
      alone. She is a contemptible old thing, but she is able to twist people
      round her little finger, and I admire that in her, at all events! How mean
      it all is, and how foolish! We were always middle-class, thoroughly
      middle-class, people. Why should we attempt to climb into the giddy
      heights of the fashionable world? My sisters are all for it. It&rsquo;s Prince
      S. they have to thank for poisoning their minds. Why are you so glad that
      Evgenie Pavlovitch is coming?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me, Aglaya,&rdquo; said the prince, &ldquo;I do believe you are nervous
      lest I shall make a fool of myself tomorrow at your party?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nervous about you?&rdquo; Aglaya blushed. &ldquo;Why should I be nervous about you?
      What would it matter to me if you were to make ever such a fool of
      yourself? How can you say such a thing? What do you mean by &lsquo;making a fool
      of yourself&rsquo;? What a vulgar expression! I suppose you intend to talk in
      that sort of way tomorrow evening? Look up a few more such expressions in
      your dictionary; do, you&rsquo;ll make a grand effect! I&rsquo;m sorry that you seem
      to be able to come into a room as gracefully as you do; where did you
      learn the art? Do you think you can drink a cup of tea decently, when you
      know everybody is looking at you, on purpose to see how you do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you? I&rsquo;m sorry for it then, for I should have had a good laugh at you
      otherwise. Do break <i>something</i> at least, in the drawing-room! Upset
      the Chinese vase, won&rsquo;t you? It&rsquo;s a valuable one; <i>do</i> break it.
      Mamma values it, and she&rsquo;ll go out of her mind&mdash;it was a present.
      She&rsquo;ll cry before everyone, you&rsquo;ll see! Wave your hand about, you know, as
      you always do, and just smash it. Sit down near it on purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, I shall sit as far from it as I can. Thanks for the
      hint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, ha! Then you are afraid you <i>will</i> wave your arms about! I
      wouldn&rsquo;t mind betting that you&rsquo;ll talk about some lofty subject, something
      serious and learned. How delightful, how tactful that will be!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think it would be very foolish indeed, unless it happened to
      come in appropriately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, once for all,&rdquo; cried Aglaya, boiling over, &ldquo;if I hear you
      talking about capital punishment, or the economical condition of Russia,
      or about Beauty redeeming the world, or anything of that sort, I&rsquo;ll&mdash;well,
      of course I shall laugh and seem very pleased, but I warn you beforehand,
      don&rsquo;t look me in the face again! I&rsquo;m serious now, mind, this time I <i>am
      really</i> serious.&rdquo; She certainly did say this very seriously, so much
      so, that she looked quite different from what she usually was, and the
      prince could not help noticing the fact. She did not seem to be joking in
      the slightest degree.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve put me into such a fright that I shall certainly make a fool
      of myself, and very likely break something too. I wasn&rsquo;t a bit alarmed
      before, but now I&rsquo;m as nervous as can be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t speak at all. Sit still and don&rsquo;t talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t do that, you know! I shall say something foolish out of pure
      &lsquo;funk,&rsquo; and break something for the same excellent reason; I know I shall.
      Perhaps I shall slip and fall on the slippery floor; I&rsquo;ve done that before
      now, you know. I shall dream of it all night now. Why did you say anything
      about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aglaya looked blackly at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what, I had better not come at all tomorrow! I&rsquo;ll plead
      sick-list and stay away,&rdquo; said the prince, with decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aglaya stamped her foot, and grew quite pale with anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my goodness! Just listen to that! &lsquo;Better not come,&rsquo; when the party
      is on purpose for him! Good Lord! What a delightful thing it is to have to
      do with such a&mdash;such a stupid as you are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll come, I&rsquo;ll come,&rdquo; interrupted the prince, hastily, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll
      give you my word of honour that I will sit the whole evening and not say a
      word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe that&rsquo;s the best thing you can do. You said you&rsquo;d &lsquo;plead
      sick-list&rsquo; just now; where in the world do you get hold of such
      expressions? Why do you talk to me like this? Are you trying to irritate
      me, or what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, it&rsquo;s a schoolboy expression. I won&rsquo;t do it again. I know
      quite well, I see it, that you are anxious on my account (now, don&rsquo;t be
      angry), and it makes me very happy to see it. You wouldn&rsquo;t believe how
      frightened I am of misbehaving somehow, and how glad I am of your
      instructions. But all this panic is simply nonsense, you know, Aglaya! I
      give you my word it is; I am so pleased that you are such a child, such a
      dear good child. How <i>charming</i> you can be if you like, Aglaya.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aglaya wanted to be angry, of course, but suddenly some quite unexpected
      feeling seized upon her heart, all in a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you won&rsquo;t reproach me for all these rude words of mine&mdash;some day&mdash;afterwards?&rdquo;
       she asked, of a sudden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an idea! Of course not. And what are you blushing for again? And
      there comes that frown once more! You&rsquo;ve taken to looking too gloomy
      sometimes, Aglaya, much more than you used to. I know why it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be quiet, do be quiet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, I had much better speak out. I have long wished to say it, and <i>have</i>
      said it, but that&rsquo;s not enough, for you didn&rsquo;t believe me. Between us two
      there stands a being who&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be quiet, be quiet, be quiet, be quiet!&rdquo; Aglaya struck in, suddenly,
      seizing his hand in hers, and gazing at him almost in terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment she was called by someone. She broke loose from him with an
      air of relief and ran away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince was in a fever all night. It was strange, but he had suffered
      from fever for several nights in succession. On this particular night,
      while in semi-delirium, he had an idea: what if on the morrow he were to
      have a fit before everybody? The thought seemed to freeze his blood within
      him. All night he fancied himself in some extraordinary society of strange
      persons. The worst of it was that he was talking nonsense; he knew that he
      ought not to speak at all, and yet he talked the whole time; he seemed to
      be trying to persuade them all to something. Evgenie and Hippolyte were
      among the guests, and appeared to be great friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      He awoke towards nine o&rsquo;clock with a headache, full of confused ideas and
      strange impressions. For some reason or other he felt most anxious to see
      Rogojin, to see and talk to him, but what he wished to say he could not
      tell. Next, he determined to go and see Hippolyte. His mind was in a
      confused state, so much so that the incidents of the morning seemed to be
      imperfectly realized, though acutely felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of these incidents was a visit from Lebedeff. Lebedeff came rather
      early&mdash;before ten&mdash;but he was tipsy already. Though the prince
      was not in an observant condition, yet he could not avoid seeing that for
      at least three days&mdash;ever since General Ivolgin had left the house
      Lebedeff had been behaving very badly. He looked untidy and dirty at all
      times of the day, and it was said that he had begun to rage about in his
      own house, and that his temper was very bad. As soon as he arrived this
      morning, he began to hold forth, beating his breast and apparently blaming
      himself for something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve&mdash;I&rsquo;ve had a reward for my meanness&mdash;I&rsquo;ve had a slap in the
      face,&rdquo; he concluded, tragically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A slap in the face? From whom? And so early in the morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Early?&rdquo; said Lebedeff, sarcastically. &ldquo;Time counts for nothing, even in
      physical chastisement; but my slap in the face was not physical, it was
      moral.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He suddenly took a seat, very unceremoniously, and began his story. It was
      very disconnected; the prince frowned, and wished he could get away; but
      suddenly a few words struck him. He sat stiff with wonder&mdash;Lebedeff
      said some extraordinary things.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first place he began about some letter; the name of Aglaya Ivanovna
      came in. Then suddenly he broke off and began to accuse the prince of
      something; he was apparently offended with him. At first he declared that
      the prince had trusted him with his confidences as to &ldquo;a certain person&rdquo;
       (Nastasia Philipovna), but that of late his friendship had been thrust
      back into his bosom, and his innocent question as to &ldquo;approaching family
      changes&rdquo; had been curtly put aside, which Lebedeff declared, with tipsy
      tears, he could not bear; especially as he knew so much already both from
      Rogojin and Nastasia Philipovna and her friend, and from Varvara
      Ardalionovna, and even from Aglaya Ivanovna, through his daughter Vera.
      &ldquo;And who told Lizabetha Prokofievna something in secret, by letter? Who
      told her all about the movements of a certain person called Nastasia
      Philipovna? Who was the anonymous person, eh? Tell me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely not you?&rdquo; cried the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; said Lebedeff, with dignity; &ldquo;and only this very morning I have
      sent up a letter to the noble lady, stating that I have a matter of great
      importance to communicate. She received the letter; I know she got it; and
      she received <i>me</i>, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you just seen Lizabetha Prokofievna?&rdquo; asked the prince, scarcely
      believing his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I saw her, and got the said slap in the face as mentioned. She
      chucked the letter back to me unopened, and kicked me out of the house,
      morally, not physically, although not far off it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What letter do you mean she returned unopened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! didn&rsquo;t I tell you? Ha, ha, ha! I thought I had. Why, I received a
      letter, you know, to be handed over&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From whom? To whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But it was difficult, if not impossible, to extract anything from
      Lebedeff. All the prince could gather was, that the letter had been
      received very early, and had a request written on the outside that it
      might be sent on to the address given.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as before, sir, just as before! To a certain person, and from a
      certain hand. The individual&rsquo;s name who wrote the letter is to be
      represented by the letter A.&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Impossible! To Nastasia Philipovna? Nonsense!&rdquo; cried the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was, I assure you, and if not to her then to Rogojin, which is the
      same thing. Mr. Hippolyte has had letters, too, and all from the
      individual whose name begins with an A.,&rdquo; smirked Lebedeff, with a hideous
      grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he kept jumping from subject to subject, and forgetting what he had
      begun to talk about, the prince said nothing, but waited, to give him
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was all very vague. Who had taken the letters, if letters there were?
      Probably Vera&mdash;and how could Lebedeff have got them? In all
      probability, he had managed to steal the present letter from Vera, and had
      himself gone over to Lizabetha Prokofievna with some idea in his head. So
      the prince concluded at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mad!&rdquo; he cried, indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not quite, esteemed prince,&rdquo; replied Lebedeff, with some acerbity. &ldquo;I
      confess I thought of doing you the service of handing the letter over to
      yourself, but I decided that it would pay me better to deliver it up to
      the noble lady aforesaid, as I had informed her of everything hitherto by
      anonymous letters; so when I sent her up a note from myself, with the
      letter, you know, in order to fix a meeting for eight o&rsquo;clock this
      morning, I signed it &lsquo;your secret correspondent.&rsquo; They let me in at once&mdash;very
      quickly&mdash;by the back door, and the noble lady received me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well? Go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, when I saw her she almost punched my head, as I say; in fact so
      nearly that one might almost say she did punch my head. She threw the
      letter in my face; she seemed to reflect first, as if she would have liked
      to keep it, but thought better of it and threw it in my face instead. &lsquo;If
      anybody can have been such a fool as to trust a man like you to deliver
      the letter,&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;take it and deliver it!&rsquo; Hey! she was grandly
      indignant. A fierce, fiery lady that, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the letter now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve still got it, here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he handed the prince the very letter from Aglaya to Gania, which the
      latter showed with so much triumph to his sister at a later hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This letter cannot be allowed to remain in your hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s for you&mdash;for you! I&rsquo;ve brought it you on purpose!&rdquo; cried
      Lebedeff, excitedly. &ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;m yours again now, heart and hand, your
      slave; there was but a momentary pause in the flow of my love and esteem
      for you. Mea culpa, mea culpa! as the Pope of Rome says.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This letter should be sent on at once,&rdquo; said the prince, disturbed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
      hand it over myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be better, esteemed prince, wouldn&rsquo;t it be better&mdash;to&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      you know&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lebedeff made a strange and very expressive grimace; he twisted about in
      his chair, and did something, apparently symbolical, with his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; said the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, open it, for the time being, don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo; he said, most
      confidentially and mysteriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince jumped up so furiously that Lebedeff ran towards the door;
      having gained which strategic position, however, he stopped and looked
      back to see if he might hope for pardon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Lebedeff, Lebedeff! Can a man really sink to such depths of
      meanness?&rdquo; said the prince, sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lebedeff&rsquo;s face brightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m a mean wretch&mdash;a mean wretch!&rdquo; he said, approaching the
      prince once more, and beating his breast, with tears in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s abominable dishonesty, you know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dishonesty&mdash;it is, it is! That&rsquo;s the very word!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What in the world induces you to act so? You are nothing but a spy. Why
      did you write anonymously to worry so noble and generous a lady? Why
      should not Aglaya Ivanovna write a note to whomever she pleases? What did
      you mean to complain of today? What did you expect to get by it? What made
      you go at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pure amiable curiosity,&mdash;I assure you&mdash;desire to do a service.
      That&rsquo;s all. Now I&rsquo;m entirely yours again, your slave; hang me if you
      like!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you go before Lizabetha Prokofievna in your present condition?&rdquo;
       inquired the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;oh no, fresher&mdash;more the correct card. I only became this
      like after the humiliation I suffered there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;that&rsquo;ll do; now leave me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This injunction had to be repeated several times before the man could be
      persuaded to move. Even then he turned back at the door, came as far as
      the middle of the room, and there went through his mysterious motions
      designed to convey the suggestion that the prince should open the letter.
      He did not dare put his suggestion into words again.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this performance, he smiled sweetly and left the room on tiptoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this had been very painful to listen to. One fact stood out certain
      and clear, and that was that poor Aglaya must be in a state of great
      distress and indecision and mental torment (&ldquo;from jealousy,&rdquo; the prince
      whispered to himself). Undoubtedly in this inexperienced, but hot and
      proud little head, there were all sorts of plans forming, wild and
      impossible plans, maybe; and the idea of this so frightened the prince
      that he could not make up his mind what to do. Something must be done,
      that was clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at the address on the letter once more. Oh, he was not in the
      least degree alarmed about Aglaya writing such a letter; he could trust
      her. What he did not like about it was that he could not trust Gania.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, he made up his mind that he would himself take the note and
      deliver it. Indeed, he went so far as to leave the house and walk up the
      road, but changed his mind when he had nearly reached Ptitsin&rsquo;s door.
      However, he there luckily met Colia, and commissioned him to deliver the
      letter to his brother as if direct from Aglaya. Colia asked no questions
      but simply delivered it, and Gania consequently had no suspicion that it
      had passed through so many hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived home again, the prince sent for Vera Lebedeff and told her as much
      as was necessary, in order to relieve her mind, for she had been in a
      dreadful state of anxiety since she had missed the letter. She heard with
      horror that her father had taken it. Muishkin learned from her that she
      had on several occasions performed secret missions both for Aglaya and for
      Rogojin, without, however, having had the slightest idea that in so doing
      she might injure the prince in any way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter, with one thing and another, was now so disturbed and confused,
      that when, a couple of hours or so later, a message came from Colia that
      the general was ill, he could hardly take the news in.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, when he did master the fact, it acted upon him as a tonic by
      completely distracting his attention. He went at once to Nina
      Alexandrovna&rsquo;s, whither the general had been carried, and stayed there
      until the evening. He could do no good, but there are people whom to have
      near one is a blessing at such times. Colia was in an almost hysterical
      state; he cried continuously, but was running about all day, all the same;
      fetching doctors, of whom he collected three; going to the chemist&rsquo;s, and
      so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general was brought round to some extent, but the doctors declared
      that he could not be said to be out of danger. Varia and Nina Alexandrovna
      never left the sick man&rsquo;s bedside; Gania was excited and distressed, but
      would not go upstairs, and seemed afraid to look at the patient. He wrung
      his hands when the prince spoke to him, and said that &ldquo;such a misfortune
      at such a moment&rdquo; was terrible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince thought he knew what Gania meant by &ldquo;such a moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hippolyte was not in the house. Lebedeff turned up late in the afternoon;
      he had been asleep ever since his interview with the prince in the
      morning. He was quite sober now, and cried with real sincerity over the
      sick general&mdash;mourning for him as though he were his own brother. He
      blamed himself aloud, but did not explain why. He repeated over and over
      again to Nina Alexandrovna that he alone was to blame&mdash;no one else&mdash;but
      that he had acted out of &ldquo;pure amiable curiosity,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;the
      deceased,&rdquo; as he insisted upon calling the still living general, had been
      the greatest of geniuses.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laid much stress on the genius of the sufferer, as if this idea must be
      one of immense solace in the present crisis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nina Alexandrovna&mdash;seeing his sincerity of feeling&mdash;said at
      last, and without the faintest suspicion of reproach in her voice: &ldquo;Come,
      come&mdash;don&rsquo;t cry! God will forgive you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lebedeff was so impressed by these words, and the tone in which they were
      spoken, that he could not leave Nina Alexandrovna all the evening&mdash;in
      fact, for several days. Till the general&rsquo;s death, indeed, he spent almost
      all his time at his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twice during the day a messenger came to Nina Alexandrovna from the
      Epanchins to inquire after the invalid.
    </p>
    <p>
      When&mdash;late in the evening&mdash;the prince made his appearance in
      Lizabetha Prokofievna&rsquo;s drawing-room, he found it full of guests. Mrs.
      Epanchin questioned him very fully about the general as soon as he
      appeared; and when old Princess Bielokonski wished to know &ldquo;who this
      general was, and who was Nina Alexandrovna,&rdquo; she proceeded to explain in a
      manner which pleased the prince very much.
    </p>
    <p>
      He himself, when relating the circumstances of the general&rsquo;s illness to
      Lizabetha Prokofievna, &ldquo;spoke beautifully,&rdquo; as Aglaya&rsquo;s sisters declared
      afterwards&mdash;&ldquo;modestly, quietly, without gestures or too many words,
      and with great dignity.&rdquo; He had entered the room with propriety and grace,
      and he was perfectly dressed; he not only did not &ldquo;fall down on the
      slippery floor,&rdquo; as he had expressed it, but evidently made a very
      favourable impression upon the assembled guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for his own impression on entering the room and taking his seat, he
      instantly remarked that the company was not in the least such as Aglaya&rsquo;s
      words had led him to fear, and as he had dreamed of&mdash;in nightmare
      form&mdash;all night.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the first time in his life that he had seen a little corner of
      what was generally known by the terrible name of &ldquo;society.&rdquo; He had long
      thirsted, for reasons of his own, to penetrate the mysteries of the magic
      circle, and, therefore, this assemblage was of the greatest possible
      interest to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first impression was one of fascination. Somehow or other he felt that
      all these people must have been born on purpose to be together! It seemed
      to him that the Epanchins were not having a party at all; that these
      people must have been here always, and that he himself was one of them&mdash;returned
      among them after a long absence, but one of them, naturally and
      indisputably.
    </p>
    <p>
      It never struck him that all this refined simplicity and nobility and wit
      and personal dignity might possibly be no more than an exquisite artistic
      polish. The majority of the guests&mdash;who were somewhat empty-headed,
      after all, in spite of their aristocratic bearing&mdash;never guessed, in
      their self-satisfied composure, that much of their superiority was mere
      veneer, which indeed they had adopted unconsciously and by inheritance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince would never so much as suspect such a thing in the delight of
      his first impression.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw, for instance, that one important dignitary, old enough to be his
      grandfather, broke off his own conversation in order to listen to <i>him</i>&mdash;a
      young and inexperienced man; and not only listened, but seemed to attach
      value to his opinion, and was kind and amiable, and yet they were
      strangers and had never seen each other before. Perhaps what most appealed
      to the prince&rsquo;s impressionability was the refinement of the old man&rsquo;s
      courtesy towards him. Perhaps the soil of his susceptible nature was
      really predisposed to receive a pleasant impression.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile all these people&mdash;though friends of the family and of each other
      to a certain extent&mdash;were very far from being such intimate friends
      of the family and of each other as the prince concluded. There were some
      present who never would think of considering the Epanchins their equals.
      There were even some who hated one another cordially. For instance, old
      Princess Bielokonski had all her life despised the wife of the
      &ldquo;dignitary,&rdquo; while the latter was very far from loving Lizabetha
      Prokofievna. The dignitary himself had been General Epanchin&rsquo;s protector
      from his youth up; and the general considered him so majestic a personage
      that he would have felt a hearty contempt for himself if he had even for
      one moment allowed himself to pose as the great man&rsquo;s equal, or to think
      of him&mdash;in his fear and reverence&mdash;as anything less than an Olympic
      God! There were others present who had not met for years, and who had no
      feeling whatever for each other, unless it were dislike; and yet they met
      tonight as though they had seen each other but yesterday in some friendly
      and intimate assembly of kindred spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not a large party, however. Besides Princess Bielokonski and the
      old dignitary (who was really a great man) and his wife, there was an old
      military general&mdash;a count or baron with a German name, a man reputed
      to possess great knowledge and administrative ability. He was one of those
      Olympian administrators who know everything except Russia, pronounce a
      word of extraordinary wisdom, admired by all, about once in five years,
      and, after being an eternity in the service, generally die full of honour
      and riches, though they have never done anything great, and have even been
      hostile to all greatness. This general was Ivan Fedorovitch&rsquo;s immediate
      superior in the service; and it pleased the latter to look upon him also
      as a patron. On the other hand, the great man did not at all consider
      himself Epanchin&rsquo;s patron. He was always very cool to him, while taking
      advantage of his ready services, and would instantly have put another in
      his place if there had been the slightest reason for the change.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another guest was an elderly, important-looking gentleman, a distant
      relative of Lizabetha Prokofievna&rsquo;s. This gentleman was rich, held a good
      position, was a great talker, and had the reputation of being &ldquo;one of the
      dissatisfied,&rdquo; though not belonging to the dangerous sections of that
      class. He had the manners, to some extent, of the English aristocracy, and
      some of their tastes (especially in the matter of under-done roast beef,
      harness, men-servants, etc.). He was a great friend of the dignitary&rsquo;s,
      and Lizabetha Prokofievna, for some reason or other, had got hold of the
      idea that this worthy intended at no distant date to offer the advantages
      of his hand and heart to Alexandra.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides the elevated and more solid individuals enumerated, there were
      present a few younger though not less elegant guests. Besides Prince S.
      and Evgenie Pavlovitch, we must name the eminent and fascinating Prince N.&mdash;once
      the vanquisher of female hearts all over Europe. This gentleman was no
      longer in the first bloom of youth&mdash;he was forty-five, but still very
      handsome. He was well off, and lived, as a rule, abroad, and was noted as
      a good teller of stories. Then came a few guests belonging to a lower
      stratum of society&mdash;people who, like the Epanchins themselves, moved
      only occasionally in this exalted sphere. The Epanchins liked to draft
      among their more elevated guests a few picked representatives of this
      lower stratum, and Lizabetha Prokofievna received much praise for this
      practice, which proved, her friends said, that she was a woman of tact.
      The Epanchins prided themselves upon the good opinion people held of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the representatives of the middle-class present today was a colonel
      of engineers, a very serious man and a great friend of Prince S., who had
      introduced him to the Epanchins. He was extremely silent in society, and
      displayed on the forefinger of his right hand a large ring, probably
      bestowed upon him for services of some sort. There was also a poet, German
      by name, but a Russian poet; very presentable, and even handsome&mdash;the sort
      of man one could bring into society with impunity. This gentleman belonged
      to a German family of decidedly bourgeois origin, but he had a knack of
      acquiring the patronage of &ldquo;big-wigs,&rdquo; and of retaining their favour. He
      had translated some great German poem into Russian verse, and claimed to
      have been a friend of a famous Russian poet, since dead. (It is strange
      how great a multitude of literary people there are who have had the
      advantages of friendship with some great man of their own profession who
      is, unfortunately, dead.) The dignitary&rsquo;s wife had introduced this worthy
      to the Epanchins. This lady posed as the patroness of literary people, and
      she certainly had succeeded in obtaining pensions for a few of them,
      thanks to her influence with those in authority on such matters. She was a
      lady of weight in her own way. Her age was about forty-five, so that she
      was a very young wife for such an elderly husband as the dignitary. She
      had been a beauty in her day and still loved, as many ladies of forty-five
      do love, to dress a little too smartly. Her intellect was nothing to boast
      of, and her literary knowledge very doubtful. Literary patronage was,
      however, with her as much a mania as was the love of gorgeous clothes.
      Many books and translations were dedicated to her by her proteges, and a
      few of these talented individuals had published some of their own letters
      to her, upon very weighty subjects.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, then, was the society that the prince accepted at once as true coin,
      as pure gold without alloy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It so happened, however, that on this particular evening all these good
      people were in excellent humour and highly pleased with themselves. Every
      one of them felt that they were doing the Epanchins the greatest possible
      honour by their presence. But alas! the prince never suspected any such
      subtleties! For instance, he had no suspicion of the fact that the
      Epanchins, having in their mind so important a step as the marriage of
      their daughter, would never think of presuming to take it without having
      previously &ldquo;shown off&rdquo; the proposed husband to the dignitary&mdash;the
      recognized patron of the family. The latter, too, though he would probably
      have received news of a great disaster to the Epanchin family with perfect
      composure, would nevertheless have considered it a personal offence if
      they had dared to marry their daughter without his advice, or we might
      almost say, his leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      The amiable and undoubtedly witty Prince N. could not but feel that he was
      as a sun, risen for one night only to shine upon the Epanchin
      drawing-room. He accounted them immeasurably his inferiors, and it was
      this feeling which caused his special amiability and delightful ease and
      grace towards them. He knew very well that he must tell some story this
      evening for the edification of the company, and led up to it with the
      inspiration of anticipatory triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince, when he heard the story afterwards, felt that he had never yet
      come across so wonderful a humorist, or such remarkable brilliancy as was
      shown by this man; and yet if he had only known it, this story was the
      oldest, stalest, and most worn-out yarn, and every drawing-room in town
      was sick to death of it. It was only in the innocent Epanchin household
      that it passed for a new and brilliant tale&mdash;as a sudden and striking
      reminiscence of a splendid and talented man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even the German poet, though as amiable as possible, felt that he was
      doing the house the greatest of honours by his presence in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the prince only looked at the bright side; he did not turn the coat
      and see the shabby lining.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aglaya had not foreseen that particular calamity. She herself looked
      wonderfully beautiful this evening. All three sisters were dressed very
      tastefully, and their hair was done with special care.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aglaya sat next to Evgenie Pavlovitch, and laughed and talked to him with
      an unusual display of friendliness. Evgenie himself behaved rather more
      sedately than usual, probably out of respect to the dignitary. Evgenie had
      been known in society for a long while. He had appeared at the Epanchins&rsquo;
      today with crape on his hat, and Princess Bielokonski had commended this
      action on his part. Not every society man would have worn crape for &ldquo;such
      an uncle.&rdquo; Lizabetha Prokofievna had liked it also, but was too
      preoccupied to take much notice. The prince remarked that Aglaya looked
      attentively at him two or three times, and seemed to be satisfied with his
      behaviour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little by little he became very happy indeed. All his late anxieties and
      apprehensions (after his conversation with Lebedeff) now appeared like so
      many bad dreams&mdash;impossible, and even laughable.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not speak much, only answering such questions as were put to him,
      and gradually settled down into unbroken silence, listening to what went
      on, and steeped in perfect satisfaction and contentment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little by little a sort of inspiration, however, began to stir within him,
      ready to spring into life at the right moment. When he did begin to speak,
      it was accidentally, in response to a question, and apparently without any
      special object.
    </p>
    <h3>
      VII.
    </h3>
    <p>
      While he feasted his eyes upon Aglaya, as she talked merrily with Evgenie
      and Prince N., suddenly the old anglomaniac, who was talking to the
      dignitary in another corner of the room, apparently telling him a story
      about something or other&mdash;suddenly this gentleman pronounced the name
      of &ldquo;Nicolai Andreevitch Pavlicheff&rdquo; aloud. The prince quickly turned
      towards him, and listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation had been on the subject of land, and the present
      disorders, and there must have been something amusing said, for the old
      man had begun to laugh at his companion&rsquo;s heated expressions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter was describing in eloquent words how, in consequence of recent
      legislation, he was obliged to sell a beautiful estate in the N. province,
      not because he wanted ready money&mdash;in fact, he was obliged to sell it
      at half its value. &ldquo;To avoid another lawsuit about the Pavlicheff estate,
      I ran away,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;With a few more inheritances of that kind I should
      soon be ruined!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this point General Epanchin, noticing how interested Muishkin had
      become in the conversation, said to him, in a low tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That gentleman&mdash;Ivan Petrovitch&mdash;is a relation of your late
      friend, Mr. Pavlicheff. You wanted to find some of his relations, did you
      not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The general, who had been talking to his chief up to this moment, had
      observed the prince&rsquo;s solitude and silence, and was anxious to draw him
      into the conversation, and so introduce him again to the notice of some of
      the important personages.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lef Nicolaievitch was a ward of Nicolai Andreevitch Pavlicheff, after the
      death of his own parents,&rdquo; he remarked, meeting Ivan Petrovitch&rsquo;s eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very happy to meet him, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; remarked the latter. &ldquo;I remember Lef
      Nicolaievitch well. When General Epanchin introduced us just now, I
      recognized you at once, prince. You are very little changed, though I saw
      you last as a child of some ten or eleven years old. There was something
      in your features, I suppose, that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You saw me as a child!&rdquo; exclaimed the prince, with surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes, long ago,&rdquo; continued Ivan Petrovitch, &ldquo;while you were living
      with my cousin at Zlatoverhoff. You don&rsquo;t remember me? No, I dare say you
      don&rsquo;t; you had some malady at the time, I remember. It was so serious that
      I was surprised&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I remember nothing!&rdquo; said the prince. A few more words of explanation
      followed, words which were spoken without the smallest excitement by his
      companion, but which evoked the greatest agitation in the prince; and it
      was discovered that two old ladies to whose care the prince had been left
      by Pavlicheff, and who lived at Zlatoverhoff, were also relations of Ivan
      Petrovitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter had no idea and could give no information as to why Pavlicheff
      had taken so great an interest in the little prince, his ward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In point of fact I don&rsquo;t think I thought much about it,&rdquo; said the old
      fellow. He seemed to have a wonderfully good memory, however, for he told
      the prince all about the two old ladies, Pavlicheff&rsquo;s cousins, who had
      taken care of him, and whom, he declared, he had taken to task for being
      too severe with the prince as a small sickly boy&mdash;the elder sister,
      at least; the younger had been kind, he recollected. They both now lived
      in another province, on a small estate left to them by Pavlicheff. The
      prince listened to all this with eyes sparkling with emotion and delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      He declared with unusual warmth that he would never forgive himself for
      having travelled about in the central provinces during these last six
      months without having hunted up his two old friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      He declared, further, that he had intended to go every day, but had always
      been prevented by circumstances; but that now he would promise himself the
      pleasure&mdash;however far it was, he would find them out. And so Ivan
      Petrovitch <i>really</i> knew Natalia Nikitishna!&mdash;what a saintly
      nature was hers!&mdash;and Martha Nikitishna! Ivan Petrovitch must excuse
      him, but really he was not quite fair on dear old Martha. She was severe,
      perhaps; but then what else could she be with such a little idiot as he
      was then? (Ha, ha.) He really was an idiot then, Ivan Petrovitch must
      know, though he might not believe it. (Ha, ha.) So he had really seen him
      there! Good heavens! And was he really and truly and actually a cousin of
      Pavlicheff&rsquo;s?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you of it,&rdquo; laughed Ivan Petrovitch, gazing amusedly at the
      prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I didn&rsquo;t say it because I <i>doubt</i> the fact, you know. (Ha, ha.)
      How could I doubt such a thing? (Ha, ha, ha.) I made the remark because&mdash;because
      Nicolai Andreevitch Pavlicheff was such a splendid man, don&rsquo;t you see!
      Such a high-souled man, he really was, I assure you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince did not exactly pant for breath, but he &ldquo;seemed almost to <i>choke</i>
      out of pure simplicity and goodness of heart,&rdquo; as Adelaida expressed it,
      on talking the party over with her fiance, the Prince S., next morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my goodness me,&rdquo; laughed Ivan Petrovitch, &ldquo;why can&rsquo;t I be cousin to
      even a splendid man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; cried the prince, confused, trying to hurry his words out, and
      growing more and more eager every moment: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve gone and said another
      stupid thing. I don&rsquo;t know what to say. I&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t mean that, you
      know&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;he really was such a splendid man, wasn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince trembled all over. Why was he so agitated? Why had he flown
      into such transports of delight without any apparent reason? He had far
      outshot the measure of joy and emotion consistent with the occasion. Why
      this was it would be difficult to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to feel warmly and deeply grateful to someone for something or
      other&mdash;perhaps to Ivan Petrovitch; but likely enough to all the
      guests, individually, and collectively. He was much too happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ivan Petrovitch began to stare at him with some surprise; the dignitary,
      too, looked at him with considerable attention; Princess Bielokonski
      glared at him angrily, and compressed her lips. Prince N., Evgenie, Prince
      S., and the girls, all broke off their own conversations and listened.
      Aglaya seemed a little startled; as for Lizabetha Prokofievna, her heart
      sank within her.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was odd of Lizabetha Prokofievna and her daughters. They had
      themselves decided that it would be better if the prince did not talk all
      the evening. Yet seeing him sitting silent and alone, but perfectly happy,
      they had been on the point of exerting themselves to draw him into one of
      the groups of talkers around the room. Now that he was in the midst of a
      talk they became more than ever anxious and perturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That he was a splendid man is perfectly true; you are quite right,&rdquo;
       repeated Ivan Petrovitch, but seriously this time. &ldquo;He was a fine and a
      worthy fellow&mdash;worthy, one may say, of the highest respect,&rdquo; he
      added, more and more seriously at each pause; &ldquo;and it is agreeable to see,
      on your part, such&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it this same Pavlicheff about whom there was a strange story in
      connection with some abbot? I don&rsquo;t remember who the abbot was, but I
      remember at one time everybody was talking about it,&rdquo; remarked the old
      dignitary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;Abbot Gurot, a Jesuit,&rdquo; said Ivan Petrovitch. &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s the
      sort of thing our best men are apt to do. A man of rank, too, and rich&mdash;a
      man who, if he had continued to serve, might have done anything; and then
      to throw up the service and everything else in order to go over to Roman
      Catholicism and turn Jesuit&mdash;openly, too&mdash;almost triumphantly.
      By Jove! it was positively a mercy that he died when he did&mdash;it was
      indeed&mdash;everyone said so at the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince was beside himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pavlicheff?&mdash;Pavlicheff turned Roman Catholic? Impossible!&rdquo; he
      cried, in horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m! impossible is rather a strong word,&rdquo; said Ivan Petrovitch. &ldquo;You must
      allow, my dear prince... However, of course you value the memory of the
      deceased so very highly; and he certainly was the kindest of men; to which
      fact, by the way, I ascribe, more than to anything else, the success of
      the abbot in influencing his religious convictions. But you may ask me, if
      you please, how much trouble and worry I, personally, had over that
      business, and especially with this same Gurot! Would you believe it,&rdquo; he
      continued, addressing the dignitary, &ldquo;they actually tried to put in a
      claim under the deceased&rsquo;s will, and I had to resort to the very strongest
      measures in order to bring them to their senses? I assure you they knew
      their cue, did these gentlemen&mdash;wonderful! Thank goodness all this
      was in Moscow, and I got the Court, you know, to help me, and we soon
      brought them to their senses.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t believe how you have pained and astonished me,&rdquo; cried the
      prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very sorry; but in point of fact, you know, it was all nonsense and would
      have ended in smoke, as usual&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure of that. Last year,&rdquo;&mdash;he
      turned to the old man again,&mdash;&ldquo;Countess K. joined some Roman Convent
      abroad. Our people never seem to be able to offer any resistance so soon
      as they get into the hands of these&mdash;intriguers&mdash;especially
      abroad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all thanks to our lassitude, I think,&rdquo; replied the old man, with
      authority. &ldquo;And then their way of preaching; they have a skilful manner of
      doing it! And they know how to startle one, too. I got quite a fright
      myself in &rsquo;32, in Vienna, I assure you; but I didn&rsquo;t cave in to them, I
      ran away instead, ha, ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, I&rsquo;ve always heard that you ran away with the beautiful
      Countess Levitsky that time&mdash;throwing up everything in order to do it&mdash;and
      not from the Jesuits at all,&rdquo; said Princess Bielokonski, suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yes&mdash;but we call it from the Jesuits, you know; it comes to
      the same thing,&rdquo; laughed the old fellow, delighted with the pleasant
      recollection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to be very religious,&rdquo; he continued, kindly, addressing the
      prince, &ldquo;which is a thing one meets so seldom nowadays among young
      people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince was listening open-mouthed, and still in a condition of excited
      agitation. The old man was evidently interested in him, and anxious to
      study him more closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pavlicheff was a man of bright intellect and a good Christian, a sincere
      Christian,&rdquo; said the prince, suddenly. &ldquo;How could he possibly embrace a
      faith which is unchristian? Roman Catholicism is, so to speak, simply the
      same thing as unchristianity,&rdquo; he added with flashing eyes, which seemed
      to take in everybody in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, that&rsquo;s a little <i>too</i> strong, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; murmured the old man,
      glancing at General Epanchin in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you make out that the Roman Catholic religion is <i>unchristian?</i>
      What is it, then?&rdquo; asked Ivan Petrovitch, turning to the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not a Christian religion, in the first place,&rdquo; said the latter, in
      extreme agitation, quite out of proportion to the necessity of the moment.
      &ldquo;And in the second place, Roman Catholicism is, in my opinion, worse than
      Atheism itself. Yes&mdash;that is my opinion. Atheism only preaches a
      negation, but Romanism goes further; it preaches a disfigured, distorted
      Christ&mdash;it preaches Anti-Christ&mdash;I assure you, I swear it! This
      is my own personal conviction, and it has long distressed me. The Roman
      Catholic believes that the Church on earth cannot stand without universal
      temporal Power. He cries &lsquo;non possumus!&rsquo; In my opinion the Roman Catholic
      religion is not a faith at all, but simply a continuation of the Roman
      Empire, and everything is subordinated to this idea&mdash;beginning with
      faith. The Pope has seized territories and an earthly throne, and has held
      them with the sword. And so the thing has gone on, only that to the sword
      they have added lying, intrigue, deceit, fanaticism, superstition,
      swindling;&mdash;they have played fast and loose with the most sacred and
      sincere feelings of men;&mdash;they have exchanged everything&mdash;everything
      for money, for base earthly <i>power!</i> And is this not the teaching of
      Anti-Christ? How could the upshot of all this be other than Atheism?
      Atheism is the child of Roman Catholicism&mdash;it proceeded from these
      Romans themselves, though perhaps they would not believe it. It grew and
      fattened on hatred of its parents; it is the progeny of their lies and
      spiritual feebleness. Atheism! In our country it is only among the upper
      classes that you find unbelievers; men who have lost the root or spirit of
      their faith; but abroad whole masses of the people are beginning to
      profess unbelief&mdash;at first because of the darkness and lies by which
      they were surrounded; but now out of fanaticism, out of loathing for the
      Church and Christianity!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince paused to get breath. He had spoken with extraordinary
      rapidity, and was very pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      All present interchanged glances, but at last the old dignitary burst out
      laughing frankly. Prince N. took out his eye-glass to have a good look at
      the speaker. The German poet came out of his corner and crept nearer to
      the table, with a spiteful smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You exaggerate the matter very much,&rdquo; said Ivan Petrovitch, with rather a
      bored air. &ldquo;There are, in the foreign Churches, many representatives of
      their faith who are worthy of respect and esteem.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but I did not speak of individual representatives. I was merely
      talking about Roman Catholicism, and its essence&mdash;of Rome itself. A
      Church can never entirely disappear; I never hinted at that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agreed that all this may be true; but we need not discuss a subject which
      belongs to the domain of theology.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no; oh, no! Not to theology alone, I assure you! Why, Socialism is
      the progeny of Romanism and of the Romanistic spirit. It and its brother
      Atheism proceed from Despair in opposition to Catholicism. It seeks to
      replace in itself the moral power of religion, in order to appease the
      spiritual thirst of parched humanity and save it; not by Christ, but by
      force. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t dare to believe in God, don&rsquo;t dare to possess any
      individuality, any property! <i>Fraternité ou la Mort</i>; two million
      heads. &lsquo;By their works ye shall know them&rsquo;&mdash;we are told. And we must
      not suppose that all this is harmless and without danger to ourselves. Oh,
      no; we must resist, and quickly, quickly! We must let our Christ shine
      forth upon the Western nations, our Christ whom we have preserved intact,
      and whom they have never known. Not as slaves, allowing ourselves to be
      caught by the hooks of the Jesuits, but carrying our Russian civilization
      to <i>them</i>, we must stand before them, not letting it be said among us
      that their preaching is &lsquo;skilful,&rsquo; as someone expressed it just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But excuse me, excuse me;&rdquo; cried Ivan Petrovitch considerably disturbed,
      and looking around uneasily. &ldquo;Your ideas are, of course, most
      praiseworthy, and in the highest degree patriotic; but you exaggerate the
      matter terribly. It would be better if we dropped the subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, I do not exaggerate, I understate the matter, if anything,
      undoubtedly understate it; simply because I cannot express myself as I
      should like, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allow me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince was silent. He sat straight up in his chair and gazed fervently
      at Ivan Petrovitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me that you have been too painfully impressed by the news of
      what happened to your good benefactor,&rdquo; said the old dignitary, kindly,
      and with the utmost calmness of demeanour. &ldquo;You are excitable, perhaps as
      the result of your solitary life. If you would make up your mind to live
      more among your fellows in society, I trust, I am sure, that the world
      would be glad to welcome you, as a remarkable young man; and you would
      soon find yourself able to look at things more calmly. You would see that
      all these things are much simpler than you think; and, besides, these rare
      cases come about, in my opinion, from ennui and from satiety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly, exactly! That is a true thought!&rdquo; cried the prince. &ldquo;From ennui,
      from our ennui but not from satiety! Oh, no, you are wrong there! Say from
      <i>thirst</i> if you like; the thirst of fever! And please do not suppose
      that this is so small a matter that we may have a laugh at it and dismiss
      it; we must be able to foresee our disasters and arm against them. We
      Russians no sooner arrive at the brink of the water, and realize that we
      are really at the brink, than we are so delighted with the outlook that in
      we plunge and swim to the farthest point we can see. Why is this? You say
      you are surprised at Pavlicheff&rsquo;s action; you ascribe it to madness, to
      kindness of heart, and what not, but it is not so.

      &ldquo;Our Russian intensity not only astonishes ourselves; all Europe wonders
      at our conduct in such cases! For, if one of us goes over to Roman
      Catholicism, he is sure to become a Jesuit at once, and a rabid one into
      the bargain. If one of us becomes an Atheist, he must needs begin to
      insist on the prohibition of faith in God by force, that is, by the sword.
      Why is this? Why does he then exceed all bounds at once? Because he has
      found land at last, the fatherland that he sought in vain before; and,
      because his soul is rejoiced to find it, he throws himself upon it and
      kisses it! Oh, it is not from vanity alone, it is not from feelings of
      vanity that Russians become Atheists and Jesuits! But from spiritual
      thirst, from anguish of longing for higher things, for dry firm land, for
      foothold on a fatherland which they never believed in because they never
      knew it. It is easier for a Russian to become an Atheist, than for any
      other nationality in the world. And not only does a Russian &lsquo;become an
      Atheist,&rsquo; but he actually <i>believes in</i> Atheism, just as though he
      had found a new faith, not perceiving that he has pinned his faith to a
      negation. Such is our anguish of thirst! &lsquo;Whoso has no country has no
      God.&rsquo; That is not my own expression; it is the expression of a merchant,
      one of the Old Believers, whom I once met while travelling. He did not say
      exactly these words. I think his expression was:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Whoso forsakes his country forsakes his God.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But let these thirsty Russian souls find, like Columbus&rsquo; discoverers, a
      new world; let them find the Russian world, let them search and discover
      all the gold and treasure that lies hid in the bosom of their own land!
      Show them the restitution of lost humanity, in the future, by Russian
      thought alone, and by means of the God and of the Christ of our Russian
      faith, and you will see how mighty and just and wise and good a giant will
      rise up before the eyes of the astonished and frightened world; astonished
      because they expect nothing but the sword from us, because they think they
      will get nothing out of us but barbarism. This has been the case up to
      now, and the longer matters go on as they are now proceeding, the more
      clear will be the truth of what I say; and I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But at this moment something happened which put a most unexpected end to
      the orator&rsquo;s speech. All this heated tirade, this outflow of passionate
      words and ecstatic ideas which seemed to hustle and tumble over each other
      as they fell from his lips, bore evidence of some unusually disturbed
      mental condition in the young fellow who had &ldquo;boiled over&rdquo; in such a
      remarkable manner, without any apparent reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of those who were present, such as knew the prince listened to his
      outburst in a state of alarm, some with a feeling of mortification. It was
      so unlike his usual timid self-constraint; so inconsistent with his usual
      taste and tact, and with his instinctive feeling for the higher
      proprieties. They could not understand the origin of the outburst; it
      could not be simply the news of Pavlicheff&rsquo;s perversion. By the ladies the
      prince was regarded as little better than a lunatic, and Princess
      Bielokonski admitted afterwards that &ldquo;in another minute she would have
      bolted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two old gentlemen looked quite alarmed. The old general (Epanchin&rsquo;s
      chief) sat and glared at the prince in severe displeasure. The colonel sat
      immovable. Even the German poet grew a little pale, though he wore his
      usual artificial smile as he looked around to see what the others would
      do.
    </p>
    <p>
      In point of fact it is quite possible that the matter would have ended in
      a very commonplace and natural way in a few minutes. The undoubtedly
      astonished, but now more collected, General Epanchin had several times
      endeavoured to interrupt the prince, and not having succeeded he was now
      preparing to take firmer and more vigorous measures to attain his end. In
      another minute or two he would probably have made up his mind to lead the
      prince quietly out of the room, on the plea of his being ill (and it was
      more than likely that the general was right in his belief that the prince
      <i>was</i> actually ill), but it so happened that destiny had something
      different in store.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the beginning of the evening, when the prince first came into the room,
      he had sat down as far as possible from the Chinese vase which Aglaya had
      spoken of the day before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Will it be believed that, after Aglaya&rsquo;s alarming words, an ineradicable
      conviction had taken possession of his mind that, however he might try to
      avoid this vase next day, he must certainly break it? But so it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the evening other impressions began to awaken in his mind, as we
      have seen, and he forgot his presentiment. But when Pavlicheff was
      mentioned and the general introduced him to Ivan Petrovitch, he had
      changed his place, and went over nearer to the table; when, it so
      happened, he took the chair nearest to the beautiful vase, which stood on
      a pedestal behind him, just about on a level with his elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke his last words he had risen suddenly from his seat with a wave
      of his arm, and there was a general cry of horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      The huge vase swayed backwards and forwards; it seemed to be uncertain
      whether or no to topple over on to the head of one of the old men, but
      eventually determined to go the other way, and came crashing over towards
      the German poet, who darted out of the way in terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crash, the cry, the sight of the fragments of valuable china covering
      the carpet, the alarm of the company&mdash;what all this meant to the poor
      prince it would be difficult to convey to the mind of the reader, or for
      him to imagine.
    </p>
    <p>
      But one very curious fact was that all the shame and vexation and
      mortification which he felt over the accident were less powerful than the
      deep impression of the almost supernatural truth of his premonition. He
      stood still in alarm&mdash;in almost superstitious alarm, for a moment;
      then all mists seemed to clear away from his eyes; he was conscious of
      nothing but light and joy and ecstasy; his breath came and went; but the
      moment passed. Thank God it was not that! He drew a long breath and looked
      around.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some minutes he did not seem to comprehend the excitement around him;
      that is, he comprehended it and saw everything, but he stood aside, as it
      were, like someone invisible in a fairy tale, as though he had nothing to
      do with what was going on, though it pleased him to take an interest in
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw them gather up the broken bits of china; he heard the loud talking
      of the guests and observed how pale Aglaya looked, and how very strangely
      she was gazing at him. There was no hatred in her expression, and no anger
      whatever. It was full of alarm for him, and sympathy and affection, while
      she looked around at the others with flashing, angry eyes. His heart
      filled with a sweet pain as he gazed at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length he observed, to his amazement, that all had taken their seats
      again, and were laughing and talking as though nothing had happened.
      Another minute and the laughter grew louder&mdash;they were laughing at
      him, at his dumb stupor&mdash;laughing kindly and merrily. Several of them
      spoke to him, and spoke so kindly and cordially, especially Lizabetha
      Prokofievna&mdash;she was saying the kindest possible things to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he became aware that General Epanchin was tapping him on the
      shoulder; Ivan Petrovitch was laughing too, but still more kind and
      sympathizing was the old dignitary. He took the prince by the hand and
      pressed it warmly; then he patted it, and quietly urged him to recollect
      himself&mdash;speaking to him exactly as he would have spoken to a little
      frightened child, which pleased the prince wonderfully; and next seated
      him beside himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince gazed into his face with pleasure, but still seemed to have no
      power to speak. His breath failed him. The old man&rsquo;s face pleased him
      greatly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really forgive me?&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;And&mdash;and Lizabetha
      Prokofievna too?&rdquo; The laugh increased, tears came into the prince&rsquo;s eyes,
      he could not believe in all this kindness&mdash;he was enchanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The vase certainly was a very beautiful one. I remember it here for
      fifteen years&mdash;yes, quite that!&rdquo; remarked Ivan Petrovitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, what a dreadful calamity! A wretched vase smashed, and a man half
      dead with remorse about it,&rdquo; said Lizabetha Prokofievna, loudly. &ldquo;What
      made you so dreadfully startled, Lef Nicolaievitch?&rdquo; she added, a little
      timidly. &ldquo;Come, my dear boy! cheer up. You really alarm me, taking the
      accident so to heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you forgive me all&mdash;<i>all</i>, besides the vase, I mean?&rdquo; said
      the prince, rising from his seat once more, but the old gentleman caught
      his hand and drew him down again&mdash;he seemed unwilling to let him go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>C&rsquo;est très-curieux et c&rsquo;est très-sérieux</i>,&rdquo; he whispered across the
      table to Ivan Petrovitch, rather loudly. Probably the prince heard him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that I have not offended any of you? You will not believe how happy I
      am to be able to think so. It is as it should be. As if I <i>could</i>
      offend anyone here! I should offend you again by even suggesting such a
      thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Calm yourself, my dear fellow. You are exaggerating again; you really
      have no occasion to be so grateful to us. It is a feeling which does you
      great credit, but an exaggeration, for all that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not exactly thanking you, I am only feeling a growing admiration for
      you&mdash;it makes me happy to look at you. I dare say I am speaking very
      foolishly, but I must speak&mdash;I must explain, if it be out of nothing
      better than self-respect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All he said and did was abrupt, confused, feverish&mdash;very likely the
      words he spoke, as often as not, were not those he wished to say. He
      seemed to inquire whether he <i>might</i> speak. His eyes lighted on
      Princess Bielokonski.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, my friend, talk away, talk away!&rdquo; she remarked. &ldquo;Only don&rsquo;t
      lose your breath; you were in such a hurry when you began, and look what
      you&rsquo;ve come to now! Don&rsquo;t be afraid of speaking&mdash;all these ladies and
      gentlemen have seen far stranger people than yourself; you don&rsquo;t astonish
      <i>them</i>. You are nothing out-of-the-way remarkable, you know. You&rsquo;ve
      done nothing but break a vase, and give us all a fright.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince listened, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it you,&rdquo; he said, suddenly turning to the old gentleman, &ldquo;who
      saved the student Porkunoff and a clerk called Shoabrin from being sent to
      Siberia, two or three months since?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old dignitary blushed a little, and murmured that the prince had
      better not excite himself further.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I have heard of <i>you</i>,&rdquo; continued the prince, addressing Ivan
      Petrovitch, &ldquo;that when some of your villagers were burned out you gave
      them wood to build up their houses again, though they were no longer your
      serfs and had behaved badly towards you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come, come! You are exaggerating,&rdquo; said Ivan Petrovitch, beaming with
      satisfaction, all the same. He was right, however, in this instance, for
      the report had reached the prince&rsquo;s ears in an incorrect form.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, princess,&rdquo; he went on, addressing Princess Bielokonski, &ldquo;was it
      not you who received me in Moscow, six months since, as kindly as though I
      had been your own son, in response to a letter from Lizabetha Prokofievna;
      and gave me one piece of advice, again as to your own son, which I shall
      never forget? Do you remember?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you making such a fuss about?&rdquo; said the old lady, with
      annoyance. &ldquo;You are a good fellow, but very silly. One gives you a
      halfpenny, and you are as grateful as though one had saved your life. You
      think this is praiseworthy on your part, but it is not&mdash;it is not,
      indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She seemed to be very angry, but suddenly burst out laughing, quite
      good-humouredly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lizabetha Prokofievna&rsquo;s face brightened up, too; so did that of General
      Epanchin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you Lef Nicolaievitch was a man&mdash;a man&mdash;if only he would
      not be in such a hurry, as the princess remarked,&rdquo; said the latter, with
      delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aglaya alone seemed sad and depressed; her face was flushed, perhaps with
      indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He really is very charming,&rdquo; whispered the old dignitary to Ivan
      Petrovitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came into this room with anguish in my heart,&rdquo; continued the prince,
      with ever-growing agitation, speaking quicker and quicker, and with
      increasing strangeness. &ldquo;I&mdash;I was afraid of you all, and afraid of
      myself. I was most afraid of myself. When I returned to Petersburg, I
      promised myself to make a point of seeing our greatest men, and members of
      our oldest families&mdash;the old families like my own. I am now among
      princes like myself, am I not? I wished to know you, and it was necessary,
      very, very necessary. I had always heard so much that was evil said of you
      all&mdash;more evil than good; as to how small and petty were your
      interests, how absurd your habits, how shallow your education, and so on.
      There is so much written and said about you! I came here today with
      anxious curiosity; I wished to see for myself and form my own convictions
      as to whether it were true that the whole of this upper stratum of Russian
      society is <i>worthless</i>, has outlived its time, has existed too long,
      and is only fit to die&mdash;and yet is dying with petty, spiteful warring
      against that which is destined to supersede it and take its place&mdash;hindering
      the Coming Men, and knowing not that itself is in a dying condition. I did
      not fully believe in this view even before, for there never was such a
      class among us&mdash;excepting perhaps at court, by accident&mdash;or by
      uniform; but now there is not even that, is there? It has vanished, has it
      not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not a bit of it,&rdquo; said Ivan Petrovitch, with a sarcastic laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord, he&rsquo;s off again!&rdquo; said Princess Bielokonski, impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laissez-le dire! He is trembling all over,&rdquo; said the old man, in a
      warning whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince certainly was beside himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well? What have I seen?&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;I have seen men of graceful
      simplicity of intellect; I have seen an old man who is not above speaking
      kindly and even <i>listening</i> to a boy like myself; I see before me
      persons who can understand, who can forgive&mdash;kind, good Russian
      hearts&mdash;hearts almost as kind and cordial as I met abroad. Imagine
      how delighted I must have been, and how surprised! Oh, let me express this
      feeling! I have so often heard, and I have even believed, that in society
      there was nothing but empty forms, and that reality had vanished; but I
      now see for myself that this can never be the case <i>here</i>, among us&mdash;it
      may be the order elsewhere, but not in Russia. Surely you are not all
      Jesuits and deceivers! I heard Prince N.&lsquo;s story just now. Was it not
      simple-minded, spontaneous humour? Could such words come from the lips of
      a man who is dead?&mdash;a man whose heart and talents are dried up? Could
      dead men and women have treated me so kindly as you have all been treating
      me to-day? Is there not material for the future in all this&mdash;for
      hope? Can such people fail to <i>understand?</i> Can such men fall away
      from reality?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once more let us beg you to be calm, my dear boy. We&rsquo;ll talk of all this
      another time&mdash;I shall do so with the greatest pleasure, for one,&rdquo;
       said the old dignitary, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ivan Petrovitch grunted and twisted round in his chair. General Epanchin
      moved nervously. The latter&rsquo;s chief had started a conversation with the
      wife of the dignitary, and took no notice whatever of the prince, but the
      old lady very often glanced at him, and listened to what he was saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I had better speak,&rdquo; continued the prince, with a new outburst of
      feverish emotion, and turning towards the old man with an air of
      confidential trustfulness. &ldquo;Yesterday, Aglaya Ivanovna forbade me to talk,
      and even specified the particular subjects I must not touch upon&mdash;she
      knows well enough that I am odd when I get upon these matters. I am nearly
      twenty-seven years old, and yet I know I am little better than a child. I
      have no right to express my ideas, and said so long ago. Only in Moscow,
      with Rogojin, did I ever speak absolutely freely! He and I read Pushkin
      together&mdash;all his works. Rogojin knew nothing of Pushkin, had not
      even heard his name. I am always afraid of spoiling a great Thought or
      Idea by my absurd manner. I have no eloquence, I know. I always make the
      wrong gestures&mdash;inappropriate gestures&mdash;and therefore I degrade
      the Thought, and raise a laugh instead of doing my subject justice. I have
      no sense of proportion either, and that is the chief thing. I know it
      would be much better if I were always to sit still and say nothing. When I
      do so, I appear to be quite a sensible sort of a person, and what&rsquo;s more,
      I think about things. But now I must speak; it is better that I should. I
      began to speak because you looked so kindly at me; you have such a
      beautiful face. I promised Aglaya Ivanovna yesterday that I would not
      speak all the evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really?&rdquo; said the old man, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, at times, I can&rsquo;t help thinking that I am wrong in feeling so about
      it, you know. Sincerity is more important than elocution, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to explain all to you&mdash;everything&mdash;everything! I know
      you think me Utopian, don&rsquo;t you&mdash;an idealist? Oh, no! I&rsquo;m not, indeed&mdash;my
      ideas are all so simple. You don&rsquo;t believe me? You are smiling. Do you
      know, I am sometimes very wicked&mdash;for I lose my faith? This evening
      as I came here, I thought to myself, &lsquo;What shall I talk about? How am I to
      begin, so that they may be able to understand partially, at all events?&rsquo;
      How afraid I was&mdash;dreadfully afraid! And yet, how <i>could</i> I be
      afraid&mdash;was it not shameful of me? Was I afraid of finding a
      bottomless abyss of empty selfishness? Ah! that&rsquo;s why I am so happy at
      this moment, because I find there is no bottomless abyss at all&mdash;but
      good, healthy material, full of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not such a very dreadful circumstance that we are odd people, is
      it? For we really are odd, you know&mdash;careless, reckless, easily
      wearied of anything. We don&rsquo;t look thoroughly into matters&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      care to understand things. We are all like this&mdash;you and I, and all
      of them! Why, here are you, now&mdash;you are not a bit angry with me for
      calling you &lsquo;odd,&rsquo; are you? And, if so, surely there is good material in
      you? Do you know, I sometimes think it is a good thing to be odd. We can
      forgive one another more easily, and be more humble. No one can begin by
      being perfect&mdash;there is much one cannot understand in life at first.
      In order to attain to perfection, one must begin by failing to understand
      much. And if we take in knowledge too quickly, we very likely are not
      taking it in at all. I say all this to you&mdash;you who by this time
      understand so much&mdash;and doubtless have failed to understand so much,
      also. I am not afraid of you any longer. You are not angry that a mere boy
      should say such words to you, are you? Of course not! You know how to
      forget and to forgive. You are laughing, Ivan Petrovitch? You think I am a
      champion of other classes of people&mdash;that I am <i>their</i> advocate,
      a democrat, and an orator of Equality?&rdquo; The prince laughed hysterically;
      he had several times burst into these little, short nervous laughs. &ldquo;Oh,
      no&mdash;it is for you, for myself, and for all of us together, that I am
      alarmed. I am a prince of an old family myself, and I am sitting among my
      peers; and I am talking like this in the hope of saving us all; in the
      hope that our class will not disappear altogether&mdash;into the darkness&mdash;unguessing
      its danger&mdash;blaming everything around it, and losing ground every
      day. Why should we disappear and give place to others, when we may still,
      if we choose, remain in the front rank and lead the battle? Let us be
      servants, that we may become lords in due season!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He tried to get upon his feet again, but the old man still restrained him,
      gazing at him with increasing perturbation as he went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen&mdash;I know it is best not to speak! It is best simply to give a
      good example&mdash;simply to begin the work. I have done this&mdash;I have
      begun, and&mdash;and&mdash;oh! <i>can</i> anyone be unhappy, really? Oh!
      what does grief matter&mdash;what does misfortune matter, if one knows how
      to be happy? Do you know, I cannot understand how anyone can pass by a
      green tree, and not feel happy only to look at it! How anyone can talk to
      a man and not feel happy in loving him! Oh, it is my own fault that I
      cannot express myself well enough! But there are lovely things at every
      step I take&mdash;things which even the most miserable man must recognize
      as beautiful. Look at a little child&mdash;look at God&rsquo;s day dawn&mdash;look
      at the grass growing&mdash;look at the eyes that love you, as they gaze
      back into your eyes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had risen, and was speaking standing up. The old gentleman was looking
      at him now in unconcealed alarm. Lizabetha Prokofievna wrung her hands.
      &ldquo;Oh, my God!&rdquo; she cried. She had guessed the state of the case before
      anyone else.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aglaya rushed quickly up to him, and was just in time to receive him in
      her arms, and to hear with dread and horror that awful, wild cry as he
      fell writhing to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      There he lay on the carpet, and someone quickly placed a cushion under his
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one had expected this.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a quarter of an hour or so Prince N. and Evgenie Pavlovitch and the old
      dignitary were hard at work endeavouring to restore the harmony of the
      evening, but it was of no avail, and very soon after the guests separated
      and went their ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      A great deal of sympathy was expressed; a considerable amount of advice
      was volunteered; Ivan Petrovitch expressed his opinion that the young man
      was &ldquo;a Slavophile, or something of that sort&rdquo;; but that it was not a
      dangerous development. The old dignitary said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      True enough, most of the guests, next day and the day after, were not in
      very good humour. Ivan Petrovitch was a little offended, but not seriously
      so. General Epanchin&rsquo;s chief was rather cool towards him for some while
      after the occurrence. The old dignitary, as patron of the family, took the
      opportunity of murmuring some kind of admonition to the general, and
      added, in flattering terms, that he was most interested in Aglaya&rsquo;s
      future. He was a man who really did possess a kind heart, although his
      interest in the prince, in the earlier part of the evening, was due, among
      other reasons, to the latter&rsquo;s connection with Nastasia Philipovna,
      according to popular report. He had heard a good deal of this story here
      and there, and was greatly interested in it, so much so that he longed to
      ask further questions about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Princess Bielokonski, as she drove away on this eventful evening, took
      occasion to say to Lizabetha Prokofievna:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;he&rsquo;s a good match&mdash;and a bad one; and if you want my
      opinion, more bad than good. You can see for yourself the man is an
      invalid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lizabetha therefore decided that the prince was impossible as a husband
      for Aglaya; and during the ensuing night she made a vow that never while
      she lived should he marry Aglaya. With this resolve firmly impressed upon
      her mind, she awoke next day; but during the morning, after her early
      lunch, she fell into a condition of remarkable inconsistency.
    </p>
    <p>
      In reply to a very guarded question of her sisters&rsquo;, Aglaya had answered
      coldly, but exceedingly haughtily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never given him my word at all, nor have I ever counted him as my
      future husband&mdash;never in my life. He is just as little to me as all
      the rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lizabetha Prokofievna suddenly flared up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not expect that of you, Aglaya,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He is an impossible
      husband for you,&mdash;I know it; and thank God that we agree upon that
      point; but I did not expect to hear such words from you. I thought I
      should hear a very different tone from you. I would have turned out
      everyone who was in the room last night and kept him,&mdash;that&rsquo;s the
      sort of man he is, in my opinion!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here she suddenly paused, afraid of what she had just said. But she little
      knew how unfair she was to her daughter at that moment. It was all settled
      in Aglaya&rsquo;s mind. She was only waiting for the hour that would bring the
      matter to a final climax; and every hint, every careless probing of her
      wound, did but further lacerate her heart.
    </p>
    <h3>
      VIII.
    </h3>
    <p>
      This same morning dawned for the prince pregnant with no less painful
      presentiments,&mdash;which fact his physical state was, of course, quite
      enough to account for; but he was so indefinably melancholy,&mdash;his
      sadness could not attach itself to anything in particular, and this
      tormented him more than anything else. Of course certain facts stood
      before him, clear and painful, but his sadness went beyond all that he
      could remember or imagine; he realized that he was powerless to console
      himself unaided. Little by little he began to develop the expectation that
      this day something important, something decisive, was to happen to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      His attack of yesterday had been a slight one. Excepting some little
      heaviness in the head and pain in the limbs, he did not feel any
      particular effects. His brain worked all right, though his soul was heavy
      within him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose late, and immediately upon waking remembered all about the
      previous evening; he also remembered, though not quite so clearly, how,
      half an hour after his fit, he had been carried home.
    </p>
    <p>
      He soon heard that a messenger from the Epanchins&rsquo; had already been to
      inquire after him. At half-past eleven another arrived; and this pleased
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vera Lebedeff was one of the first to come to see him and offer her
      services. No sooner did she catch sight of him than she burst into tears;
      but when he tried to soothe her she began to laugh. He was quite struck by
      the girl&rsquo;s deep sympathy for him; he seized her hand and kissed it. Vera
      flushed crimson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she exclaimed in alarm, snatching her hand away. She
      went hastily out of the room in a state of strange confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lebedeff also came to see the prince, in a great hurry to get away to the
      &ldquo;deceased,&rdquo; as he called General Ivolgin, who was alive still, but very
      ill. Colia also turned up, and begged the prince for pity&rsquo;s sake to tell
      him all he knew about his father which had been concealed from him till
      now. He said he had found out nearly everything since yesterday; the poor
      boy was in a state of deep affliction. With all the sympathy which he
      could bring into play, the prince told Colia the whole story without
      reserve, detailing the facts as clearly as he could. The tale struck Colia
      like a thunderbolt. He could not speak. He listened silently, and cried
      softly to himself the while. The prince perceived that this was an
      impression which would last for the whole of the boy&rsquo;s life. He made haste
      to explain his view of the matter, and pointed out that the old man&rsquo;s
      approaching death was probably brought on by horror at the thought of his
      action; and that it was not everyone who was capable of such a feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colia&rsquo;s eyes flashed as he listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gania and Varia and Ptitsin are a worthless lot! I shall not quarrel with
      them; but from this moment our feet shall not travel the same road. Oh,
      prince, I have felt much that is quite new to me since yesterday! It is a
      lesson for me. I shall now consider my mother as entirely my
      responsibility; though she may be safe enough with Varia. Still, meat and
      drink is not everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He jumped up and hurried off, remembering suddenly that he was wanted at
      his father&rsquo;s bedside; but before he went out of the room he inquired
      hastily after the prince&rsquo;s health, and receiving the latter&rsquo;s reply,
      added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there something else, prince? I heard yesterday, but I have no
      right to talk about this... If you ever want a true friend and servant&mdash;neither
      you nor I are so very happy, are we?&mdash;come to me. I won&rsquo;t ask you
      questions, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He ran off and left the prince more dejected than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone seemed to be speaking prophetically, hinting at some misfortune
      or sorrow to come; they had all looked at him as though they knew
      something which he did not know. Lebedeff had asked questions, Colia had
      hinted, and Vera had shed tears. What was it?
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, with a sigh of annoyance, he said to himself that it was nothing
      but his own cursed sickly suspicion. His face lighted up with joy when, at
      about two o&rsquo;clock, he espied the Epanchins coming along to pay him a short
      visit, &ldquo;just for a minute.&rdquo; They really had only come for a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lizabetha Prokofievna had announced, directly after lunch, that they would
      all take a walk together. The information was given in the form of a
      command, without explanation, drily and abruptly. All had issued forth in
      obedience to the mandate; that is, the girls, mamma, and Prince S.
      Lizabetha Prokofievna went off in a direction exactly contrary to the
      usual one, and all understood very well what she was driving at, but held
      their peace, fearing to irritate the good lady. She, as though anxious to
      avoid any conversation, walked ahead, silent and alone. At last Adelaida
      remarked that it was no use racing along at such a pace, and that she
      could not keep up with her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said Lizabetha Prokofievna, turning round suddenly; &ldquo;we are
      passing his house. Whatever Aglaya may think, and in spite of anything
      that may happen, he is not a stranger to us; besides which, he is ill and
      in misfortune. I, for one, shall call in and see him. Let anyone follow me
      who cares to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of course every one of them followed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince hastened to apologize, very properly, for yesterday&rsquo;s mishap
      with the vase, and for the scene generally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; replied Lizabetha; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sorry for the vase, I&rsquo;m
      sorry for you. H&rsquo;m! so you can see that there was a &lsquo;scene,&rsquo; can you?
      Well, it doesn&rsquo;t matter much, for everyone must realize now that it is
      impossible to be hard on you. Well, <i>au revoir</i>. I advise you to have
      a walk, and then go to sleep again if you can. Come in as usual, if you
      feel inclined; and be assured, once for all, whatever happens, and
      whatever may have happened, you shall always remain the friend of the
      family&mdash;mine, at all events. I can answer for myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In response to this challenge all the others chimed in and re-echoed
      mamma&rsquo;s sentiments.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so they took their departure; but in this hasty and kindly designed
      visit there was hidden a fund of cruelty which Lizabetha Prokofievna never
      dreamed of. In the words &ldquo;as usual,&rdquo; and again in her added, &ldquo;mine, at all
      events,&rdquo; there seemed an ominous knell of some evil to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince began to think of Aglaya. She had certainly given him a
      wonderful smile, both at coming and again at leave-taking, but had not
      said a word, not even when the others all professed their friendship for
      him. She had looked very intently at him, but that was all. Her face had
      been paler than usual; she looked as though she had slept badly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince made up his mind that he would make a point of going there &ldquo;as
      usual,&rdquo; tonight, and looked feverishly at his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vera came in three minutes after the Epanchins had left. &ldquo;Lef
      Nicolaievitch,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Aglaya Ivanovna has just given me a message for
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it a note?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, a verbal message; she had hardly time even for that. She begs you
      earnestly not to go out of the house for a single moment all to-day, until
      seven o&rsquo;clock in the evening. It may have been nine; I didn&rsquo;t quite hear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but, why is this? What does it mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know at all; but she said I was to tell you particularly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she say that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not those very words. She only just had time to whisper as she went by;
      but by the way she looked at me I knew it was important. She looked at me
      in a way that made my heart stop beating.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince asked a few more questions, and though he learned nothing else,
      he became more and more agitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left alone, he lay down on the sofa, and began to think.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;someone is to be with them until nine tonight and
      she is afraid that I may come and make a fool of myself again, in public.&rdquo;
       So he spent his time longing for the evening and looking at his watch. But
      the clearing-up of the mystery came long before the evening, and came in
      the form of a new and agonizing riddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour after the Epanchins had gone, Hippolyte arrived, so tired
      that, almost unconscious, he sank into a chair, and broke into such a fit
      of coughing that he could not stop. He coughed till the blood came. His
      eyes glittered, and two red spots on his cheeks grew brighter and
      brighter. The prince murmured something to him, but Hippolyte only signed
      that he must be left alone for a while, and sat silent. At last he came to
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am off,&rdquo; he said, hoarsely, and with difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I see you home?&rdquo; asked the prince, rising from his seat, but
      suddenly stopping short as he remembered Aglaya&rsquo;s prohibition against
      leaving the house. Hippolyte laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean that I am going to leave your house,&rdquo; he continued, still
      gasping and coughing. &ldquo;On the contrary, I thought it absolutely necessary
      to come and see you; otherwise I should not have troubled you. I am off
      there, you know, and this time I believe, seriously, that I am off! It&rsquo;s
      all over. I did not come here for sympathy, believe me. I lay down this
      morning at ten o&rsquo;clock with the intention of not rising again before that
      time; but I thought it over and rose just once more in order to come here;
      from which you may deduce that I had some reason for wishing to come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It grieves me to see you so, Hippolyte. Why didn&rsquo;t you send me a message?
      I would have come up and saved you this trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well! Enough! You&rsquo;ve pitied me, and that&rsquo;s all that good manners
      exact. I forgot, how are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right; yesterday I was a little&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, I heard; the china vase caught it! I&rsquo;m sorry I wasn&rsquo;t there. I&rsquo;ve
      come about something important. In the first place I had, the pleasure of
      seeing Gavrila Ardalionovitch and Aglaya Ivanovna enjoying a rendezvous on
      the green bench in the park. I was astonished to see what a fool a man can
      look. I remarked upon the fact to Aglaya Ivanovna when he had gone. I
      don&rsquo;t think anything ever surprises you, prince!&rdquo; added Hippolyte, gazing
      incredulously at the prince&rsquo;s calm demeanour. &ldquo;To be astonished by nothing
      is a sign, they say, of a great intellect. In my opinion it would serve
      equally well as a sign of great foolishness. I am not hinting about you;
      pardon me! I am very unfortunate today in my expressions.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew yesterday that Gavrila Ardalionovitch&mdash;&rdquo; began the prince,
      and paused in evident confusion, though Hippolyte had shown annoyance at
      his betraying no surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You knew it? Come, that&rsquo;s news! But no&mdash;perhaps better not tell me.
      And were you a witness of the meeting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you were there yourself you must have known that I was <i>not</i>
      there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! but you may have been sitting behind the bushes somewhere. However, I
      am very glad, on your account, of course. I was beginning to be afraid
      that Mr. Gania&mdash;might have the preference!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask you, Hippolyte, not to talk of this subject? And not to use
      such expressions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Especially as you know all, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are wrong. I know scarcely anything, and Aglaya Ivanovna is aware
      that I know nothing. I knew nothing whatever about this meeting. You say
      there was a meeting. Very well; let&rsquo;s leave it so&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what do you mean? You said you knew, and now suddenly you know
      nothing! You say &lsquo;very well; let&rsquo;s leave it so.&rsquo; But I say, don&rsquo;t be so
      confiding, especially as you know nothing. You are confiding simply <i>because</i>
      you know nothing. But do you know what these good people have in their
      minds&rsquo; eye&mdash;Gania and his sister? Perhaps you are suspicious? Well,
      well, I&rsquo;ll drop the subject!&rdquo; he added, hastily, observing the prince&rsquo;s
      impatient gesture. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve come to you on my own business; I wish to
      make you a clear explanation. What a nuisance it is that one cannot die
      without explanations! I have made such a quantity of them already. Do you
      wish to hear what I have to say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak away, I am listening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, but I&rsquo;ll change my mind, and begin about Gania. Just fancy to
      begin with, if you can, that I, too, was given an appointment at the green
      bench today! However, I won&rsquo;t deceive you; I asked for the appointment. I
      said I had a secret to disclose. I don&rsquo;t know whether I came there too
      early, I think I must have; but scarcely had I sat down beside Aglaya
      Ivanovna than I saw Gavrila Ardalionovitch and his sister Varia coming
      along, arm in arm, just as though they were enjoying a morning walk
      together. Both of them seemed very much astonished, not to say disturbed,
      at seeing me; they evidently had not expected the pleasure. Aglaya
      Ivanovna blushed up, and was actually a little confused. I don&rsquo;t know
      whether it was merely because I was there, or whether Gania&rsquo;s beauty was
      too much for her! But anyway, she turned crimson, and then finished up the
      business in a very funny manner. She jumped up from her seat, bowed back
      to Gania, smiled to Varia, and suddenly observed: &lsquo;I only came here to
      express my gratitude for all your kind wishes on my behalf, and to say
      that if I find I need your services, believe me&mdash;&rsquo; Here she bowed
      them away, as it were, and they both marched off again, looking very
      foolish. Gania evidently could not make head nor tail of the matter, and
      turned as red as a lobster; but Varia understood at once that they must
      get away as quickly as they could, so she dragged Gania away; she is a
      great deal cleverer than he is. As for myself, I went there to arrange a
      meeting to be held between Aglaya Ivanovna and Nastasia Philipovna.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nastasia Philipovna!&rdquo; cried the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aha! I think you are growing less cool, my friend, and are beginning to
      be a trifle surprised, aren&rsquo;t you? I&rsquo;m glad that you are not above
      ordinary human feelings, for once. I&rsquo;ll console you a little now, after
      your consternation. See what I get for serving a young and high-souled
      maiden! This morning I received a slap in the face from the lady!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A&mdash;a moral one?&rdquo; asked the prince, involuntarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;not a physical one! I don&rsquo;t suppose anyone&mdash;even a woman&mdash;would
      raise a hand against me now. Even Gania would hesitate! I did think at one
      time yesterday, that he would fly at me, though. I bet anything that I
      know what you are thinking of now! You are thinking: &lsquo;Of course one can&rsquo;t
      strike the little wretch, but one could suffocate him with a pillow, or a
      wet towel, when he is asleep! One <i>ought</i> to get rid of him somehow.&rsquo;
      I can see in your face that you are thinking that at this very second.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never thought of such a thing for a moment,&rdquo; said the prince, with
      disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;I dreamed last night that I was being suffocated with
      a wet cloth by&mdash;somebody. I&rsquo;ll tell you who it was&mdash;Rogojin!
      What do you think, can a man be suffocated with a wet cloth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard so. Well, we&rsquo;ll leave that question just now. Why am I a
      scandal-monger? Why did she call me a scandal-monger? And mind, <i>after</i>
      she had heard every word I had to tell her, and had asked all sorts of
      questions besides&mdash;but such is the way of women. For <i>her</i> sake
      I entered into relations with Rogojin&mdash;an interesting man! At <i>her</i>
      request I arranged a personal interview between herself and Nastasia
      Philipovna. Could she have been angry because I hinted that she was
      enjoying Nastasia Philipovna&rsquo;s &lsquo;leavings&rsquo;? Why, I have been impressing it
      upon her all this while for her own good. Two letters have I written her
      in that strain, and I began straight off today about its being humiliating
      for her. Besides, the word &lsquo;leavings&rsquo; is not my invention. At all events,
      they all used it at Gania&rsquo;s, and she used it herself. So why am I a
      scandal-monger? I see&mdash;I see you are tremendously amused, at this
      moment! Probably you are laughing at me and fitting those silly lines to
      my case&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Maybe sad Love upon his setting smiles, And with vain hopes his farewell
      hour beguiles.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, ha, ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hippolyte suddenly burst into a fit of hysterical laughter, which turned
      into a choking cough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Observe,&rdquo; he gasped, through his coughing, &ldquo;what a fellow Gania is! He
      talks about Nastasia&rsquo;s &lsquo;leavings,&rsquo; but what does he want to take himself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince sat silent for a long while. His mind was filled with dread and
      horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You spoke of a meeting with Nastasia Philipovna,&rdquo; he said at last, in a
      low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;come! Surely you must know that there is to be a meeting today
      between Nastasia and Aglaya Ivanovna, and that Nastasia has been sent for
      on purpose, through Rogojin, from St. Petersburg? It has been brought
      about by invitation of Aglaya Ivanovna and my own efforts, and Nastasia is
      at this moment with Rogojin, not far from here&mdash;at Dana Alexeyevna&rsquo;s&mdash;that
      curious friend of hers; and to this questionable house Aglaya Ivanovna is
      to proceed for a friendly chat with Nastasia Philipovna, and for the
      settlement of several problems. They are going to play at arithmetic&mdash;didn&rsquo;t
      you know about it? Word of honour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a most improbable story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, very well! if it&rsquo;s improbable&mdash;it is&mdash;that&rsquo;s all! And yet&mdash;where
      should you have heard it? Though I must say, if a fly crosses the room
      it&rsquo;s known all over the place here. However, I&rsquo;ve warned you, and you may
      be grateful to me. Well&mdash;<i>au revoir</i>&mdash;probably in the next
      world! One more thing&mdash;don&rsquo;t think that I am telling you all this for
      your sake. Oh, dear, no! Do you know that I dedicated my confession to
      Aglaya Ivanovna? I did though, and how she took it, ha, ha! Oh, no! I am
      not acting from any high, exalted motives. But though I may have behaved
      like a cad to you, I have not done <i>her</i> any harm. I don&rsquo;t apologize
      for my words about &lsquo;leavings&rsquo; and all that. I am atoning for that, you
      see, by telling you the place and time of the meeting. Goodbye! You had
      better take your measures, if you are worthy the name of a man! The
      meeting is fixed for this evening&mdash;that&rsquo;s certain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hippolyte walked towards the door, but the prince called him back and he
      stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you think Aglaya Ivanovna herself intends to go to Nastasia
      Philipovna&rsquo;s tonight?&rdquo; he asked, and bright hectic spots came out on his
      cheeks and forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know absolutely for certain; but in all probability it is so,&rdquo;
       replied Hippolyte, looking round. &ldquo;Nastasia would hardly go to her; and
      they can&rsquo;t meet at Gania&rsquo;s, with a man nearly dead in the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s impossible, for that very reason,&rdquo; said the prince. &ldquo;How would she
      get out if she wished to? You don&rsquo;t know the habits of that house&mdash;she
      <i>could</i> not get away alone to Nastasia Philipovna&rsquo;s! It&rsquo;s all
      nonsense!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, my dear prince, no one jumps out of the window if they can
      help it; but when there&rsquo;s a fire, the dandiest gentleman or the finest
      lady in the world will skip out! When the moment comes, and there&rsquo;s
      nothing else to be done&mdash;our young lady will go to Nastasia
      Philipovna&rsquo;s! Don&rsquo;t they let the young ladies out of the house alone,
      then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean that exactly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you didn&rsquo;t mean that, then she has only to go down the steps and walk
      off, and she need never come back unless she chooses: Ships are burned
      behind one sometimes, and one doesn&rsquo;t care to return whence one came. Life
      need not consist only of lunches, and dinners, and Prince S&rsquo;s. It strikes
      me you take Aglaya Ivanovna for some conventional boarding-school girl. I
      said so to her, and she quite agreed with me. Wait till seven or eight
      o&rsquo;clock. In your place I would send someone there to keep watch, so as to
      seize the exact moment when she steps out of the house. Send Colia. He&rsquo;ll
      play the spy with pleasure&mdash;for you at least. Ha, ha, ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hippolyte went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no reason for the prince to set anyone to watch, even if he had
      been capable of such a thing. Aglaya&rsquo;s command that he should stay at home
      all day seemed almost explained now. Perhaps she meant to call for him,
      herself, or it might be, of course, that she was anxious to make sure of
      his not coming there, and therefore bade him remain at home. His head
      whirled; the whole room seemed to be turning round. He lay down on the
      sofa, and closed his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      One way or the other the question was to be decided at last&mdash;finally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, no, he did not think of Aglaya as a boarding-school miss, or a young
      lady of the conventional type! He had long since feared that she might
      take some such step as this. But why did she wish to see Nastasia?
    </p>
    <p>
      He shivered all over as he lay; he was in high fever again.
    </p>
    <p>
      No! he did not account her a child. Certain of her looks, certain of her
      words, of late, had filled him with apprehension. At times it had struck
      him that she was putting too great a restraint upon herself, and he
      remembered that he had been alarmed to observe this. He had tried, all
      these days, to drive away the heavy thoughts that oppressed him; but what
      was the hidden mystery of that soul? The question had long tormented him,
      although he implicitly trusted that soul. And now it was all to be cleared
      up. It was a dreadful thought. And &ldquo;that woman&rdquo; again! Why did he always
      feel as though &ldquo;that woman&rdquo; were fated to appear at each critical moment
      of his life, and tear the thread of his destiny like a bit of rotten
      string? That he always <i>had</i> felt this he was ready to swear,
      although he was half delirious at the moment. If he had tried to forget
      her, all this time, it was simply because he was afraid of her. Did he
      love the woman or hate her? This question he did not once ask himself
      today; his heart was quite pure. He knew whom he loved. He was not so much
      afraid of this meeting, nor of its strangeness, nor of any reasons there
      might be for it, unknown to himself; he was afraid of the woman herself,
      Nastasia Philipovna. He remembered, some days afterwards, how during all
      those fevered hours he had seen but <i>her</i> eyes, <i>her</i> look, had
      heard <i>her</i> voice, strange words of hers; he remembered that this was
      so, although he could not recollect the details of his thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could remember that Vera brought him some dinner, and that he took it;
      but whether he slept after dinner, or no, he could not recollect.
    </p>
    <p>
      He only knew that he began to distinguish things clearly from the moment
      when Aglaya suddenly appeared, and he jumped up from the sofa and went to
      meet her. It was just a quarter past seven then.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aglaya was quite alone, and dressed, apparently hastily, in a light
      mantle. Her face was pale, as it had been in the morning, and her eyes
      were ablaze with bright but subdued fire. He had never seen that
      expression in her eyes before.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gazed attentively at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quite ready, I observe,&rdquo; she said, with absolute composure,
      &ldquo;dressed, and your hat in your hand. I see somebody has thought fit to
      warn you, and I know who. Hippolyte?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he told me,&rdquo; said the prince, feeling only half alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come then. You know, I suppose, that you must escort me there? You are
      well enough to go out, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am well enough; but is it really possible?&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He broke off abruptly, and could not add another word. This was his one
      attempt to stop the mad child, and, after he had made it, he followed her
      as though he had no will of his own. Confused as his thoughts were, he
      was, nevertheless, capable of realizing the fact that if he did not go
      with her, she would go alone, and so he must go with her at all hazards.
      He guessed the strength of her determination; it was beyond him to check
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked silently, and said scarcely a word all the way. He only
      noticed that she seemed to know the road very well; and once, when he
      thought it better to go by a certain lane, and remarked to her that it
      would be quieter and less public, she only said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all the same,&rdquo; and
      went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they were almost arrived at Daria Alexeyevna&rsquo;s house (it was a large
      wooden structure of ancient date), a gorgeously-dressed lady and a young
      girl came out of it. Both these ladies took their seats in a carriage,
      which was waiting at the door, talking and laughing loudly the while, and
      drove away without appearing to notice the approaching couple.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner had the carriage driven off than the door opened once more; and
      Rogojin, who had apparently been awaiting them, let them in and closed it
      after them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is not another soul in the house now excepting our four selves,&rdquo; he
      said aloud, looking at the prince in a strange way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nastasia Philipovna was waiting for them in the first room they went into.
      She was dressed very simply, in black.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose at their entrance, but did not smile or give her hand, even to
      the prince. Her anxious eyes were fixed upon Aglaya. Both sat down, at a
      little distance from one another&mdash;Aglaya on the sofa, in the corner
      of the room, Nastasia by the window. The prince and Rogojin remained
      standing, and were not invited to sit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Muishkin glanced at Rogojin in perplexity, but the latter only smiled
      disagreeably, and said nothing. The silence continued for some few
      moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      An ominous expression passed over Nastasia Philipovna&rsquo;s face, of a sudden.
      It became obstinate-looking, hard, and full of hatred; but she did not
      take her eyes off her visitors for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aglaya was clearly confused, but not frightened. On entering she had
      merely glanced momentarily at her rival, and then had sat still, with her
      eyes on the ground, apparently in thought. Once or twice she glanced
      casually round the room. A shade of disgust was visible in her expression;
      she looked as though she were afraid of contamination in this place.
    </p>
    <p>
      She mechanically arranged her dress, and fidgeted uncomfortably,
      eventually changing her seat to the other end of the sofa. Probably she
      was unconscious of her own movements; but this very unconsciousness added
      to the offensiveness of their suggested meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length she looked straight into Nastasia&rsquo;s eyes, and instantly read all
      there was to read in her rival&rsquo;s expression. Woman understood woman!
      Aglaya shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know of course why I requested this meeting?&rdquo; she said at last,
      quietly, and pausing twice in the delivery of this very short sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;I know nothing about it,&rdquo; said Nastasia, drily and abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aglaya blushed. Perhaps it struck her as very strange and impossible that
      she should really be sitting here and waiting for &ldquo;that woman&rsquo;s&rdquo; reply to
      her question.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the first sound of Nastasia&rsquo;s voice a shudder ran through her frame. Of
      course &ldquo;that woman&rdquo; observed and took in all this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know quite well, but you are pretending to be ignorant,&rdquo; said Aglaya,
      very low, with her eyes on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I?&rdquo; asked Nastasia Philipovna, smiling slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want to take advantage of my position, now that I am in your house,&rdquo;
       continued Aglaya, awkwardly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For that position <i>you</i> are to blame and not I,&rdquo; said Nastasia,
      flaring up suddenly. &ldquo;<i>I</i> did not invite <i>you</i>, but you me; and
      to this moment I am quite ignorant as to why I am thus honoured.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aglaya raised her head haughtily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Restrain your tongue!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I did not come here to fight you with
      your own weapons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! then you did come &lsquo;to fight,&rsquo; I may conclude? Dear me!&mdash;and I
      thought you were cleverer&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They looked at one another with undisguised malice. One of these women had
      written to the other, so lately, such letters as we have seen; and it all
      was dispersed at their first meeting. Yet it appeared that not one of the
      four persons in the room considered this in any degree strange.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince who, up to yesterday, would not have believed that he could
      even dream of such an impossible scene as this, stood and listened and
      looked on, and felt as though he had long foreseen it all. The most
      fantastic dream seemed suddenly to have been metamorphosed into the most
      vivid reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of these women so despised the other, and so longed to express her
      contempt for her (perhaps she had only come for that very purpose, as
      Rogojin said next day), that howsoever fantastical was the other woman,
      howsoever afflicted her spirit and disturbed her understanding, no
      preconceived idea of hers could possibly stand up against that deadly
      feminine contempt of her rival. The prince felt sure that Nastasia would
      say nothing about the letters herself; but he could judge by her flashing
      eyes and the expression of her face what the thought of those letters must
      be costing her at this moment. He would have given half his life to
      prevent Aglaya from speaking of them. But Aglaya suddenly braced herself
      up, and seemed to master herself fully, all in an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have not quite understood,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I did not come to quarrel with
      you, though I do not like you. I came to speak to you as... as one human
      being to another. I came with my mind made up as to what I had to say to
      you, and I shall not change my intention, although you may misunderstand
      me. So much the worse for you, not for myself! I wished to reply to all
      you have written to me and to reply personally, because I think that is
      the more convenient way. Listen to my reply to all your letters. I began
      to be sorry for Prince Lef Nicolaievitch on the very day I made his
      acquaintance, and when I heard&mdash;afterwards&mdash;of all that took
      place at your house in the evening, I was sorry for him because he was
      such a simple-minded man, and because he, in the simplicity of his soul,
      believed that he could be happy with a woman of your character. What I
      feared actually took place; you could not love him, you tortured him, and
      threw him over. You could not love him because you are too proud&mdash;no,
      not proud, that is an error; because you are too vain&mdash;no, not quite
      that either; too self-loving; you are self-loving to madness. Your letters
      to me are a proof of it. You could not love so simple a soul as his, and
      perhaps in your heart you despised him and laughed at him. All you could
      love was your shame and the perpetual thought that you were disgraced and
      insulted. If you were less shameful, or had no cause at all for shame, you
      would be still more unhappy than you are now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aglaya brought out these thronging words with great satisfaction. They
      came from her lips hurriedly and impetuously, and had been prepared and
      thought out long ago, even before she had ever dreamed of the present
      meeting. She watched with eagerness the effect of her speech as shown in
      Nastasia&rsquo;s face, which was distorted with agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You remember,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;he wrote me a letter at that time; he says
      you know all about that letter and that you even read it. I understand all
      by means of this letter, and understand it correctly. He has since
      confirmed it all to me&mdash;what I now say to you, word for word. After
      receiving his letter I waited; I guessed that you would soon come back
      here, because you could never do without Petersburg; you are still too
      young and lovely for the provinces. However, this is not my own idea,&rdquo; she
      added, blushing dreadfully; and from this moment the colour never left her
      cheeks to the end of her speech. &ldquo;When I next saw the prince I began to
      feel terribly pained and hurt on his account. Do not laugh; if you laugh
      you are unworthy of understanding what I say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely you see that I am not laughing,&rdquo; said Nastasia, sadly and sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However, it&rsquo;s all the same to me; laugh or not, just as you please. When
      I asked him about you, he told me that he had long since ceased to love
      you, that the very recollection of you was a torture to him, but that he
      was sorry for you; and that when he thought of you his heart was pierced.
      I ought to tell you that I never in my life met a man anything like him
      for noble simplicity of mind and for boundless trustfulness. I guessed
      that anyone who liked could deceive him, and that he would immediately
      forgive anyone who did deceive him; and it was for this that I grew to
      love him&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aglaya paused for a moment, as though suddenly brought up in astonishment
      that she could have said these words, but at the same time a great pride
      shone in her eyes, like a defiant assertion that it would not matter to
      her if &ldquo;this woman&rdquo; laughed in her face for the admission just made.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have told you all now, and of course you understand what I wish of
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I do; but tell me yourself,&rdquo; said Nastasia Philipovna, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aglaya flushed up angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wished to find out from you,&rdquo; she said, firmly, &ldquo;by what right you dare
      to meddle with his feelings for me? By what right you dared send me those
      letters? By what right do you continually remind both me and him that you
      love him, after you yourself threw him over and ran away from him in so
      insulting and shameful a way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never told either him or you that I loved him!&rdquo; replied Nastasia
      Philipovna, with an effort. &ldquo;And&mdash;and I did run away from him&mdash;you
      are right there,&rdquo; she added, scarcely audibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never told either him or me?&rdquo; cried Aglaya. &ldquo;How about your letters? Who
      asked you to try to persuade me to marry him? Was not that a declaration
      from you? Why do you force yourself upon us in this way? I confess I
      thought at first that you were anxious to arouse an aversion for him in my
      heart by your meddling, in order that I might give him up; and it was only
      afterwards that I guessed the truth. You imagined that you were doing an
      heroic action! How could you spare any love for him, when you love your
      own vanity to such an extent? Why could you not simply go away from here,
      instead of writing me those absurd letters? Why do you not <i>now</i>
      marry that generous man who loves you, and has done you the honour of
      offering you his hand? It is plain enough why; if you marry Rogojin you
      lose your grievance; you will have nothing more to complain of. You will
      be receiving too much honour. Evgenie Pavlovitch was saying the other day
      that you had read too many poems and are too well educated for&mdash;your
      position; and that you live in idleness. Add to this your vanity, and,
      there you have reason enough&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you not live in idleness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Things had come to this unexpected point too quickly. Unexpected because
      Nastasia Philipovna, on her way to Pavlofsk, had thought and considered a
      good deal, and had expected something different, though perhaps not
      altogether good, from this interview; but Aglaya had been carried away by
      her own outburst, just as a rolling stone gathers impetus as it careers
      downhill, and could not restrain herself in the satisfaction of revenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was strange, Nastasia Philipovna felt, to see Aglaya like this. She
      gazed at her, and could hardly believe her eyes and ears for a moment or
      two.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether she were a woman who had read too many poems, as Evgenie
      Pavlovitch supposed, or whether she were mad, as the prince had assured
      Aglaya, at all events, this was a woman who, in spite of her occasionally
      cynical and audacious manner, was far more refined and trustful and
      sensitive than appeared. There was a certain amount of romantic dreaminess
      and caprice in her, but with the fantastic was mingled much that was
      strong and deep.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince realized this, and great suffering expressed itself in his
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aglaya observed it, and trembled with anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How dare you speak so to me?&rdquo; she said, with a haughtiness which was
      quite indescribable, replying to Nastasia&rsquo;s last remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have misunderstood what I said,&rdquo; said Nastasia, in some
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you wished to preserve your good name, why did you not give up your&mdash;your
      &lsquo;guardian,&rsquo; Totski, without all that theatrical posturing?&rdquo; said Aglaya,
      suddenly a propos of nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you know of my position, that you dare to judge me?&rdquo; cried
      Nastasia, quivering with rage, and growing terribly white.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know this much, that you did not go out to honest work, but went away
      with a rich man, Rogojin, in order to pose as a fallen angel. I don&rsquo;t
      wonder that Totski was nearly driven to suicide by such a fallen angel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; cried Nastasia Philipovna. &ldquo;You are about as fit to understand
      me as the housemaid here, who bore witness against her lover in court the
      other day. She would understand me better than you do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably an honest girl living by her own toil. Why do you speak of a
      housemaid so contemptuously?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not despise toil; I despise you when you speak of toil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you had cared to be an honest woman, you would have gone out as a
      laundress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both had risen, and were gazing at one another with pallid faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aglaya, don&rsquo;t! This is unfair,&rdquo; cried the prince, deeply distressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rogojin was not smiling now; he sat and listened with folded arms, and
      lips tight compressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, look at her,&rdquo; cried Nastasia, trembling with passion. &ldquo;Look at
      this young lady! And I imagined her an angel! Did you come to me without
      your governess, Aglaya Ivanovna? Oh, fie, now shall I just tell you why
      you came here today? Shall I tell you without any embellishments? You came
      because you were afraid of me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afraid of <i>you?</i>&rdquo; asked Aglaya, beside herself with naive amazement
      that the other should dare talk to her like this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, me, of course! Of course you were afraid of me, or you would not
      have decided to come. You cannot despise one you fear. And to think that I
      have actually esteemed you up to this very moment! Do you know why you are
      afraid of me, and what is your object now? You wished to satisfy yourself
      with your own eyes as to which he loves best, myself or you, because you
      are fearfully jealous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has told me already that he hates you,&rdquo; murmured Aglaya, scarcely
      audibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps, perhaps! I am not worthy of him, I know. But I think you are
      lying, all the same. He cannot hate me, and he cannot have said so. I am
      ready to forgive you, in consideration of your position; but I confess I
      thought better of you. I thought you were wiser, and more beautiful, too;
      I did, indeed! Well, take your treasure! See, he is gazing at you, he
      can&rsquo;t recollect himself. Take him, but on one condition; go away at once,
      this instant!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She fell back into a chair, and burst into tears. But suddenly some new
      expression blazed in her eyes. She stared fixedly at Aglaya, and rose from
      her seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or would you like me to bid him, <i>bid him</i>, do you hear, <i>command
      him</i>, now, at once, to throw you up, and remain mine for ever? Shall I?
      He will stay, and he will marry me too, and you shall trot home all alone.
      Shall I?&mdash;shall I say the word?&rdquo; she screamed like a madwoman,
      scarcely believing herself that she could really pronounce such wild
      words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aglaya had made for the door in terror, but she stopped at the threshold,
      and listened. &ldquo;Shall I turn Rogojin off? Ha! ha! you thought I would marry
      him for your benefit, did you? Why, I&rsquo;ll call out <i>now</i>, if you like,
      in your presence, &lsquo;Rogojin, get out!&rsquo; and say to the prince, &lsquo;Do you
      remember what you promised me?&rsquo; Heavens! what a fool I have been to
      humiliate myself before them! Why, prince, you yourself gave me your word
      that you would marry me whatever happened, and would never abandon me. You
      said you loved me and would forgive me all, and&mdash;and resp&mdash;yes,
      you even said that! I only ran away from you in order to set you free, and
      now I don&rsquo;t care to let you go again. Why does she treat me so&mdash;so
      shamefully? I am not a loose woman&mdash;ask Rogojin there! He&rsquo;ll tell
      you. Will you go again now that she has insulted me, before your eyes,
      too; turn away from me and lead her away, arm-in-arm? May you be accursed
      too, for you were the only one I trusted among them all! Go away, Rogojin,
      I don&rsquo;t want you,&rdquo; she continued, blind with fury, and forcing the words
      out with dry lips and distorted features, evidently not believing a single
      word of her own tirade, but, at the same time, doing her utmost to prolong
      the moment of self-deception.
    </p>
    <p>
      The outburst was so terribly violent that the prince thought it would have
      killed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There he is!&rdquo; she shrieked again, pointing to the prince and addressing
      Aglaya. &ldquo;There he is! and if he does not approach me at once and take <i>me</i>
      and throw you over, then have him for your own&mdash;I give him up to you!
      I don&rsquo;t want him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both she and Aglaya stood and waited as though in expectation, and both
      looked at the prince like madwomen.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he, perhaps, did not understand the full force of this challenge; in
      fact, it is certain he did not. All he could see was the poor despairing
      face which, as he had said to Aglaya, &ldquo;had pierced his heart for ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He could bear it no longer, and with a look of entreaty, mingled with
      reproach, he addressed Aglaya, pointing to Nastasia the while:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you?&rdquo; he murmured; &ldquo;she is so unhappy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he had no time to say another word before Aglaya&rsquo;s terrible look
      bereft him of speech. In that look was embodied so dreadful a suffering
      and so deadly a hatred, that he gave a cry and flew to her; but it was too
      late.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not hold out long enough even to witness his movement in her
      direction. She had hidden her face in her hands, cried once &ldquo;Oh, my God!&rdquo;
       and rushed out of the room. Rogojin followed her to undo the bolts of the
      door and let her out into the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince made a rush after her, but he was caught and held back. The
      distorted, livid face of Nastasia gazed at him reproachfully, and her blue
      lips whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Would you go to her&mdash;to her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She fell senseless into his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      He raised her, carried her into the room, placed her in an arm-chair, and
      stood over her, stupefied. On the table stood a tumbler of water. Rogojin,
      who now returned, took this and sprinkled a little in her face. She opened
      her eyes, but for a moment she understood nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly she looked around, shuddered, gave a loud cry, and threw herself
      in the prince&rsquo;s arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mine, mine!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Has the proud young lady gone? Ha, ha, ha!&rdquo; she
      laughed hysterically. &ldquo;And I had given him up to her! Why&mdash;why did I?
      Mad&mdash;mad! Get away, Rogojin! Ha, ha, ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rogojin stared intently at them; then he took his hat, and without a word,
      left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few moments later, the prince was seated by Nastasia on the sofa, gazing
      into her eyes and stroking her face and hair, as he would a little
      child&rsquo;s. He laughed when she laughed, and was ready to cry when she cried.
      He did not speak, but listened to her excited, disconnected chatter,
      hardly understanding a word of it the while. No sooner did he detect the
      slightest appearance of complaining, or weeping, or reproaching, than he
      would smile at her kindly, and begin stroking her hair and her cheeks,
      soothing and consoling her once more, as if she were a child.
    </p>
    <h3>
      IX.
    </h3>
    <p>
      A fortnight had passed since the events recorded in the last chapter, and
      the position of the actors in our story had become so changed that it is
      almost impossible for us to continue the tale without some few
      explanations. Yet we feel that we ought to limit ourselves to the simple
      record of facts, without much attempt at explanation, for a very patent
      reason: because we ourselves have the greatest possible difficulty in
      accounting for the facts to be recorded. Such a statement on our part may
      appear strange to the reader. How is anyone to tell a story which he
      cannot understand himself? In order to keep clear of a false position, we
      had perhaps better give an example of what we mean; and probably the
      intelligent reader will soon understand the difficulty. More especially
      are we inclined to take this course since the example will constitute a
      distinct march forward of our story, and will not hinder the progress of
      the events remaining to be recorded.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the next fortnight&mdash;that is, through the early part of July&mdash;the
      history of our hero was circulated in the form of strange, diverting, most
      unlikely-sounding stories, which passed from mouth to mouth, through the
      streets and villas adjoining those inhabited by Lebedeff, Ptitsin,
      Nastasia Philipovna and the Epanchins; in fact, pretty well through the
      whole town and its environs. All society&mdash;both the inhabitants of the
      place and those who came down of an evening for the music&mdash;had got
      hold of one and the same story, in a thousand varieties of detail&mdash;as
      to how a certain young prince had raised a terrible scandal in a most
      respectable household, had thrown over a daughter of the family, to whom
      he was engaged, and had been captured by a woman of shady reputation whom
      he was determined to marry at once&mdash;breaking off all old ties for the
      satisfaction of his insane idea; and, in spite of the public indignation
      roused by his action, the marriage was to take place in Pavlofsk openly
      and publicly, and the prince had announced his intention of going through
      with it with head erect and looking the whole world in the face. The story
      was so artfully adorned with scandalous details, and persons of so great
      eminence and importance were apparently mixed up in it, while, at the same
      time, the evidence was so circumstantial, that it was no wonder the matter
      gave food for plenty of curiosity and gossip.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to the reports of the most talented gossip-mongers&mdash;those
      who, in every class of society, are always in haste to explain every event
      to their neighbours&mdash;the young gentleman concerned was of good family&mdash;a
      prince&mdash;fairly rich&mdash;weak of intellect, but a democrat and a
      dabbler in the Nihilism of the period, as exposed by Mr. Turgenieff. He
      could hardly talk Russian, but had fallen in love with one of the Miss
      Epanchins, and his suit met with so much encouragement that he had been
      received in the house as the recognized bridegroom-to-be of the young
      lady. But like the Frenchman of whom the story is told that he studied for
      holy orders, took all the oaths, was ordained priest, and next morning
      wrote to his bishop informing him that, as he did not believe in God and
      considered it wrong to deceive the people and live upon their pockets, he
      begged to surrender the orders conferred upon him the day before, and to
      inform his lordship that he was sending this letter to the public press,&mdash;like
      this Frenchman, the prince played a false game. It was rumoured that he
      had purposely waited for the solemn occasion of a large evening party at
      the house of his future bride, at which he was introduced to several
      eminent persons, in order publicly to make known his ideas and opinions,
      and thereby insult the &ldquo;big-wigs,&rdquo; and to throw over his bride as
      offensively as possible; and that, resisting the servants who were told
      off to turn him out of the house, he had seized and thrown down a
      magnificent china vase. As a characteristic addition to the above, it was
      currently reported that the young prince really loved the lady to whom he
      was engaged, and had thrown her over out of purely Nihilistic motives,
      with the intention of giving himself the satisfaction of marrying a fallen
      woman in the face of all the world, thereby publishing his opinion that
      there is no distinction between virtuous and disreputable women, but that
      all women are alike, free; and a &ldquo;fallen&rdquo; woman, indeed, somewhat superior
      to a virtuous one.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was declared that he believed in no classes or anything else, excepting
      &ldquo;the woman question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All this looked likely enough, and was accepted as fact by most of the
      inhabitants of the place, especially as it was borne out, more or less, by
      daily occurrences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course much was said that could not be determined absolutely. For
      instance, it was reported that the poor girl had so loved her future
      husband that she had followed him to the house of the other woman, the day
      after she had been thrown over; others said that he had insisted on her
      coming, himself, in order to shame and insult her by his taunts and
      Nihilistic confessions when she reached the house. However all these
      things might be, the public interest in the matter grew daily, especially
      as it became clear that the scandalous wedding was undoubtedly to take
      place.
    </p>
    <p>
      So that if our readers were to ask an explanation, not of the wild reports
      about the prince&rsquo;s Nihilistic opinions, but simply as to how such a
      marriage could possibly satisfy his real aspirations, or as to the
      spiritual condition of our hero at this time, we confess that we should
      have great difficulty in giving the required information.
    </p>
    <p>
      All we know is, that the marriage really was arranged, and that the prince
      had commissioned Lebedeff and Keller to look after all the necessary
      business connected with it; that he had requested them to spare no
      expense; that Nastasia herself was hurrying on the wedding; that Keller
      was to be the prince&rsquo;s best man, at his own earnest request; and that
      Burdovsky was to give Nastasia away, to his great delight. The wedding was
      to take place before the middle of July.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, besides the above, we are cognizant of certain other undoubted facts,
      which puzzle us a good deal because they seem flatly to contradict the
      foregoing.
    </p>
    <p>
      We suspect, for instance, that having commissioned Lebedeff and the
      others, as above, the prince immediately forgot all about masters of
      ceremonies and even the ceremony itself; and we feel quite certain that in
      making these arrangements he did so in order that he might absolutely
      escape all thought of the wedding, and even forget its approach if he
      could, by detailing all business concerning it to others.
    </p>
    <p>
      What did he think of all this time, then? What did he wish for? There is
      no doubt that he was a perfectly free agent all through, and that as far
      as Nastasia was concerned, there was no force of any kind brought to bear
      on him. Nastasia wished for a speedy marriage, true!&mdash;but the prince
      agreed at once to her proposals; he agreed, in fact, so casually that
      anyone might suppose he was but acceding to the most simple and ordinary
      suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many strange circumstances such as this before us; but in our
      opinion they do but deepen the mystery, and do not in the smallest degree
      help us to understand the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, let us take one more example. Thus, we know for a fact that
      during the whole of this fortnight the prince spent all his days and
      evenings with Nastasia; he walked with her, drove with her; he began to be
      restless whenever he passed an hour without seeing her&mdash;in fact, to
      all appearances, he sincerely loved her. He would listen to her for hours
      at a time with a quiet smile on his face, scarcely saying a word himself.
      And yet we know, equally certainly, that during this period he several
      times set off, suddenly, to the Epanchins&rsquo;, not concealing the fact from
      Nastasia Philipovna, and driving the latter to absolute despair. We know
      also that he was not received at the Epanchins&rsquo; so long as they remained
      at Pavlofsk, and that he was not allowed an interview with Aglaya;&mdash;but
      next day he would set off once more on the same errand, apparently quite
      oblivious of the fact of yesterday&rsquo;s visit having been a failure,&mdash;and,
      of course, meeting with another refusal. We know, too, that exactly an
      hour after Aglaya had fled from Nastasia Philipovna&rsquo;s house on that
      fateful evening, the prince was at the Epanchins&rsquo;,&mdash;and that his
      appearance there had been the cause of the greatest consternation and
      dismay; for Aglaya had not been home, and the family only discovered then,
      for the first time, that the two of them had been to Nastasia&rsquo;s house
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was said that Elizabetha Prokofievna and her daughters had there and
      then denounced the prince in the strongest terms, and had refused any
      further acquaintance and friendship with him; their rage and denunciations
      being redoubled when Varia Ardalionovna suddenly arrived and stated that
      Aglaya had been at her house in a terrible state of mind for the last
      hour, and that she refused to come home.
    </p>
    <p>
      This last item of news, which disturbed Lizabetha Prokofievna more than
      anything else, was perfectly true. On leaving Nastasia&rsquo;s, Aglaya had felt
      that she would rather die than face her people, and had therefore gone
      straight to Nina Alexandrovna&rsquo;s. On receiving the news, Lizabetha and her
      daughters and the general all rushed off to Aglaya, followed by Prince Lef
      Nicolaievitch&mdash;undeterred by his recent dismissal; but through Varia
      he was refused a sight of Aglaya here also. The end of the episode was
      that when Aglaya saw her mother and sisters crying over her and not
      uttering a word of reproach, she had flung herself into their arms and
      gone straight home with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was said that Gania managed to make a fool of himself even on this
      occasion; for, finding himself alone with Aglaya for a minute or two when
      Varia had gone to the Epanchins&rsquo;, he had thought it a fitting opportunity
      to make a declaration of his love, and on hearing this Aglaya, in spite of
      her state of mind at the time, had suddenly burst out laughing, and had
      put a strange question to him. She asked him whether he would consent to
      hold his finger to a lighted candle in proof of his devotion! Gania&mdash;it
      was said&mdash;looked so comically bewildered that Aglaya had almost
      laughed herself into hysterics, and had rushed out of the room and
      upstairs,&mdash;where her parents had found her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hippolyte told the prince this last story, sending for him on purpose.
      When Muishkin heard about the candle and Gania&rsquo;s finger he had laughed so
      that he had quite astonished Hippolyte,&mdash;and then shuddered and burst
      into tears. The prince&rsquo;s condition during those days was strange and
      perturbed. Hippolyte plainly declared that he thought he was out of his
      mind;&mdash;this, however, was hardly to be relied upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Offering all these facts to our readers and refusing to explain them, we
      do not for a moment desire to justify our hero&rsquo;s conduct. On the contrary,
      we are quite prepared to feel our share of the indignation which his
      behaviour aroused in the hearts of his friends. Even Vera Lebedeff was
      angry with him for a while; so was Colia; so was Keller, until he was
      selected for best man; so was Lebedeff himself,&mdash;who began to
      intrigue against him out of pure irritation;&mdash;but of this anon. In
      fact we are in full accord with certain forcible words spoken to the
      prince by Evgenie Pavlovitch, quite unceremoniously, during the course of
      a friendly conversation, six or seven days after the events at Nastasia
      Philipovna&rsquo;s house.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may remark here that not only the Epanchins themselves, but all who had
      anything to do with them, thought it right to break with the prince in
      consequence of his conduct. Prince S. even went so far as to turn away and
      cut him dead in the street. But Evgenie Pavlovitch was not afraid to
      compromise himself by paying the prince a visit, and did so, in spite of
      the fact that he had recommenced to visit at the Epanchins&rsquo;, where he was
      received with redoubled hospitality and kindness after the temporary
      estrangement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evgenie called upon the prince the day after that on which the Epanchins
      left Pavlofsk. He knew of all the current rumours,&mdash;in fact, he had
      probably contributed to them himself. The prince was delighted to see him,
      and immediately began to speak of the Epanchins;&mdash;which simple and
      straightforward opening quite took Evgenie&rsquo;s fancy, so that he melted at
      once, and plunged <i>in medias res</i> without ceremony.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince did not know, up to this, that the Epanchins had left the
      place. He grew very pale on hearing the news; but a moment later he nodded
      his head, and said thoughtfully:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew it was bound to be so.&rdquo; Then he added quickly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where have they gone to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Evgenie meanwhile observed him attentively, and the rapidity of the
      questions, their simplicity, the prince&rsquo;s candour, and at the same time,
      his evident perplexity and mental agitation, surprised him considerably.
      However, he told Muishkin all he could, kindly and in detail. The prince
      hardly knew anything, for this was the first informant from the household
      whom he had met since the estrangement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evgenie reported that Aglaya had been really ill, and that for two nights
      she had not slept at all, owing to high fever; that now she was better and
      out of serious danger, but still in a nervous, hysterical state.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good thing that there is peace in the house, at all events,&rdquo; he
      continued. &ldquo;They never utter a hint about the past, not only in Aglaya&rsquo;s
      presence, but even among themselves. The old people are talking of a trip
      abroad in the autumn, immediately after Adelaida&rsquo;s wedding; Aglaya
      received the news in silence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Evgenie himself was very likely going abroad also; so were Prince S. and
      his wife, if affairs allowed of it; the general was to stay at home. They
      were all at their estate of Colmina now, about twenty miles or so from St.
      Petersburg. Princess Bielokonski had not returned to Moscow yet, and was
      apparently staying on for reasons of her own. Lizabetha Prokofievna had
      insisted that it was quite impossible to remain in Pavlofsk after what had
      happened. Evgenie had told her of all the rumours current in town about
      the affair; so that there could be no talk of their going to their house
      on the Yelagin as yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And in point of fact, prince,&rdquo; added Evgenie Pavlovitch, &ldquo;you must allow
      that they could hardly have stayed here, considering that they knew of all
      that went on at your place, and in the face of your daily visits to their
      house, visits which you insisted upon making in spite of their refusal to
      see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes, quite so; you are quite right. I wished to see Aglaya
      Ivanovna, you know!&rdquo; said the prince, nodding his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my dear fellow,&rdquo; cried Evgenie, warmly, with real sorrow in his
      voice, &ldquo;how could you permit all that to come about as it has? Of course,
      of course, I know it was all so unexpected. I admit that you, only
      naturally, lost your head, and&mdash;and could not stop the foolish girl;
      that was not in your power. I quite see so much; but you really should
      have understood how seriously she cared for you. She could not bear to
      share you with another; and you could bring yourself to throw away and
      shatter such a treasure! Oh, prince, prince!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, you are quite right again,&rdquo; said the poor prince, in anguish of
      mind. &ldquo;I was wrong, I know. But it was only Aglaya who looked on Nastasia
      Philipovna so; no one else did, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s just the worst of it all, don&rsquo;t you see, that there was
      absolutely nothing serious about the matter in reality!&rdquo; cried Evgenie,
      beside himself: &ldquo;Excuse me, prince, but I have thought over all this; I
      have thought a great deal over it; I know all that had happened before; I
      know all that took place six months since; and I know there was <i>nothing</i>
      serious about the matter, it was but fancy, smoke, fantasy, distorted by
      agitation, and only the alarmed jealousy of an absolutely inexperienced
      girl could possibly have mistaken it for serious reality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Evgenie Pavlovitch quite let himself go, and gave the reins to his
      indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clearly and reasonably, and with great psychological insight, he drew a
      picture of the prince&rsquo;s past relations with Nastasia Philipovna. Evgenie
      Pavlovitch always had a ready tongue, but on this occasion his eloquence,
      surprised himself. &ldquo;From the very beginning,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you began with a
      lie; what began with a lie was bound to end with a lie; such is the law of
      nature. I do not agree, in fact I am angry, when I hear you called an
      idiot; you are far too intelligent to deserve such an epithet; but you are
      so far <i>strange</i> as to be unlike others; that you must allow,
      yourself. Now, I have come to the conclusion that the basis of all that
      has happened, has been first of all your innate inexperience (remark the
      expression &lsquo;innate,&rsquo; prince). Then follows your unheard-of simplicity of
      heart; then comes your absolute want of sense of proportion (to this want
      you have several times confessed); and lastly, a mass, an accumulation, of
      intellectual convictions which you, in your unexampled honesty of soul,
      accept unquestionably as also innate and natural and true. Admit, prince,
      that in your relations with Nastasia Philipovna there has existed, from
      the very first, something democratic, and the fascination, so to speak, of
      the &lsquo;woman question&rsquo;? I know all about that scandalous scene at Nastasia
      Philipovna&rsquo;s house when Rogojin brought the money, six months ago. I&rsquo;ll
      show you yourself as in a looking-glass, if you like. I know exactly all
      that went on, in every detail, and why things have turned out as they
      have. You thirsted, while in Switzerland, for your home-country, for
      Russia; you read, doubtless, many books about Russia, excellent books, I
      dare say, but hurtful to <i>you</i>; and you arrived here; as it were, on
      fire with the longing to be of service. Then, on the very day of your
      arrival, they tell you a sad story of an ill-used woman; they tell <i>you</i>,
      a knight, pure and without reproach, this tale of a poor woman! The same
      day you actually <i>see</i> her; you are attracted by her beauty, her
      fantastic, almost demoniacal, beauty&mdash;(I admit her beauty, of
      course).
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Add to all this your nervous nature, your epilepsy, and your sudden
      arrival in a strange town&mdash;the day of meetings and of exciting
      scenes, the day of unexpected acquaintanceships, the day of sudden
      actions, the day of meeting with the three lovely Epanchin girls, and
      among them Aglaya&mdash;add your fatigue, your excitement; add Nastasia&rsquo; s
      evening party, and the tone of that party, and&mdash;what were you to
      expect of yourself at such a moment as that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, yes!&rdquo; said the prince, once more, nodding his head, and
      blushing slightly. &ldquo;Yes, it was so, or nearly so&mdash;I know it. And
      besides, you see, I had not slept the night before, in the train, or the
      night before that, either, and I was very tired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, of course, quite so; that&rsquo;s what I am driving at!&rdquo; continued
      Evgenie, excitedly. &ldquo;It is as clear as possible, and most comprehensible,
      that you, in your enthusiasm, should plunge headlong into the first chance
      that came of publicly airing your great idea that you, a prince, and a
      pure-living man, did not consider a woman disgraced if the sin were not
      her own, but that of a disgusting social libertine! Oh, heavens! it&rsquo;s
      comprehensible enough, my dear prince, but that is not the question,
      unfortunately! The question is, was there any reality and truth in your
      feelings? Was it nature, or nothing but intellectual enthusiasm? What do
      you think yourself? We are told, of course, that a far worse woman was <i>forgiven</i>,
      but we don&rsquo;t find that she was told that she had done well, or that she
      was worthy of honour and respect! Did not your common-sense show you what
      was the real state of the case, a few months later? The question is now,
      not whether she is an innocent woman (I do not insist one way or the other&mdash;I
      do not wish to); but can her whole career justify such intolerable pride,
      such insolent, rapacious egotism as she has shown? Forgive me, I am too
      violent, perhaps, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I dare say it is all as you say; I dare say you are quite
      right,&rdquo; muttered the prince once more. &ldquo;She is very sensitive and easily
      put out, of course; but still, she...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is worthy of sympathy? Is that what you wished to say, my good
      fellow? But then, for the mere sake of vindicating her worthiness of
      sympathy, you should not have insulted and offended a noble and generous
      girl in her presence! This is a terrible exaggeration of sympathy! How can
      you love a girl, and yet so humiliate her as to throw her over for the
      sake of another woman, before the very eyes of that other woman, when you
      have already made her a formal proposal of marriage? And you <i>did</i>
      propose to her, you know; you did so before her parents and sisters. Can
      you be an honest man, prince, if you act so? I ask you! And did you not
      deceive that beautiful girl when you assured her of your love?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you are quite right. Oh! I feel that I am very guilty!&rdquo; said
      Muishkin, in deepest distress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But as if that is enough!&rdquo; cried Evgenie, indignantly. &ldquo;As if it is
      enough simply to say: &lsquo;I know I am very guilty!&rsquo; You are to blame, and yet
      you persevere in evil-doing. Where was your heart, I should like to know,
      your <i>christian heart</i>, all that time? Did she look as though she
      were suffering less, at that moment? You saw her face&mdash;was she
      suffering less than the other woman? How could you see her suffering and
      allow it to continue? How could you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I did not allow it,&rdquo; murmured the wretched prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&mdash;what do you mean you didn&rsquo;t allow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word, I didn&rsquo;t! To this moment I don&rsquo;t know how it all happened.
      I&mdash;I ran after Aglaya Ivanovna, but Nastasia Philipovna fell down in
      a faint; and since that day they won&rsquo;t let me see Aglaya&mdash;that&rsquo;s all
      I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all the same; you ought to have run after Aglaya though the other
      was fainting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, I ought&mdash;but I couldn&rsquo;t! She would have died&mdash;she
      would have killed herself. You don&rsquo;t know her; and I should have told
      Aglaya everything afterwards&mdash;but I see, Evgenie Pavlovitch, you
      don&rsquo;t know all. Tell me now, why am I not allowed to see Aglaya? I should
      have cleared it all up, you know. Neither of them kept to the real point,
      you see. I could never explain what I mean to you, but I think I could to
      Aglaya. Oh! my God, my God! You spoke just now of Aglaya&rsquo;s face at the
      moment when she ran away. Oh, my God! I remember it! Come along, come
      along&mdash;quick!&rdquo; He pulled at Evgenie&rsquo;s coat-sleeve nervously and
      excitedly, and rose from his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to Aglaya&mdash;quick, quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I told you she is not at Pavlofsk. And what would be the use if she
      were?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;ll understand, she&rsquo;ll understand!&rdquo; cried the prince, clasping his
      hands. &ldquo;She would understand that all this is not the point&mdash;not a
      bit the real point&mdash;it is quite foreign to the real question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can it be foreign? You <i>are</i> going to be married, are you not?
      Very well, then you are persisting in your course. <i>Are</i> you going to
      marry her or not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I shall marry her&mdash;yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why is it &lsquo;not the point&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, it is not the point, not a bit. It makes no difference, my
      marrying her&mdash;it means nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How &lsquo;means nothing&rsquo;? You are talking nonsense, my friend. You are
      marrying the woman you love in order to secure her happiness, and Aglaya
      sees and knows it. How can you say that it&rsquo;s &lsquo;not the point&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her happiness? Oh, no! I am only marrying her&mdash;well, because she
      wished it. It means nothing&mdash;it&rsquo;s all the same. She would certainly
      have died. I see now that that marriage with Rogojin was an insane idea. I
      understand all now that I did not understand before; and, do you know,
      when those two stood opposite to one another, I could not bear Nastasia
      Philipovna&rsquo;s face! You must know, Evgenie Pavlovitch, I have never told
      anyone before&mdash;not even Aglaya&mdash;that I cannot bear Nastasia
      Philipovna&rsquo;s face.&rdquo; (He lowered his voice mysteriously as he said this.)
      &ldquo;You described that evening at Nastasia Philipovna&rsquo;s (six months since)
      very accurately just now; but there is one thing which you did not
      mention, and of which you took no account, because you do not know. I mean
      her <i>face</i>&mdash;I looked at her face, you see. Even in the morning
      when I saw her portrait, I felt that I could not <i>bear</i> to look at
      it. Now, there&rsquo;s Vera Lebedeff, for instance, her eyes are quite
      different, you know. I&rsquo;m <i>afraid</i> of her face!&rdquo; he added, with real
      alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are <i>afraid</i> of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;she&rsquo;s mad!&rdquo; he whispered, growing pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know this for certain?&rdquo; asked Evgenie, with the greatest
      curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, for certain&mdash;quite for certain, now! I have discovered it <i>absolutely</i>
      for certain, these last few days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing, then?&rdquo; cried Evgenie, in horror. &ldquo;You must be
      marrying her solely out of <i>fear</i>, then! I can&rsquo;t make head or tail of
      it, prince. Perhaps you don&rsquo;t even love her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no; I love her with all my soul. Why, she is a child! She&rsquo;s a child
      now&mdash;a real child. Oh! you know nothing about it at all, I see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And are you assured, at the same time, that you love Aglaya too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;oh; yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so? Do you want to make out that you love them <i>both?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;both! I do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, prince, but think what you are saying! Recollect yourself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without Aglaya&mdash;I&mdash;I <i>must</i> see Aglaya!&mdash;I shall die
      in my sleep very soon&mdash;I thought I was dying in my sleep last night.
      Oh! if Aglaya only knew all&mdash;I mean really, <i>really</i> all!
      Because she must know <i>all</i>&mdash;that&rsquo;s the first condition towards
      understanding. Why cannot we ever know all about another, especially when
      that other has been guilty? But I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m talking about&mdash;I&rsquo;m
      so confused. You pained me so dreadfully. Surely&mdash;surely Aglaya has
      not the same expression now as she had at the moment when she ran away?
      Oh, yes! I am guilty and I know it&mdash;I know it! Probably I am in fault
      all round&mdash;I don&rsquo;t quite know how&mdash;but I am in fault, no doubt.
      There is something else, but I cannot explain it to you, Evgenie
      Pavlovitch. I have no words; but Aglaya will understand. I have always
      believed Aglaya will understand&mdash;I am assured she will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, prince, she will not. Aglaya loved like a woman, like a human being,
      not like an abstract spirit. Do you know what, my poor prince? The most
      probable explanation of the matter is that you never loved either the one
      or the other in reality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;perhaps you are right in much that you have said,
      Evgenie Pavlovitch. You are very wise, Evgenie Pavlovitch&mdash;oh! how my
      head is beginning to ache again! Come to her, quick&mdash;for God&rsquo;s sake,
      come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I tell you she is not in Pavlofsk! She&rsquo;s in Colmina.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come to Colmina, then! Come&mdash;let us go at once!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;no, impossible!&rdquo; said Evgenie, rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here&mdash;I&rsquo;ll write a letter&mdash;take a letter for me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;no, prince; you must forgive me, but I can&rsquo;t undertake any such
      commissions! I really can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so they parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evgenie Pavlovitch left the house with strange convictions. He, too, felt
      that the prince must be out of his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what did he mean by that <i>face</i>&mdash;a face which he so fears,
      and yet so loves? And meanwhile he really may die, as he says, without
      seeing Aglaya, and she will never know how devotedly he loves her! Ha, ha,
      ha! How does the fellow manage to love two of them? Two different kinds of
      love, I suppose! This is very interesting&mdash;poor idiot! What on earth
      will become of him now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <h3>
      X.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The prince did not die before his wedding&mdash;either by day or night, as
      he had foretold that he might. Very probably he passed disturbed nights,
      and was afflicted with bad dreams; but, during the daytime, among his
      fellow-men, he seemed as kind as ever, and even contented; only a little
      thoughtful when alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wedding was hurried on. The day was fixed for exactly a week after
      Evgenie&rsquo;s visit to the prince. In the face of such haste as this, even the
      prince&rsquo;s best friends (if he had had any) would have felt the hopelessness
      of any attempt to save &ldquo;the poor madman.&rdquo; Rumour said that in the visit of
      Evgenie Pavlovitch was to be discerned the influence of Lizabetha
      Prokofievna and her husband... But if those good souls, in the boundless
      kindness of their hearts, were desirous of saving the eccentric young
      fellow from ruin, they were unable to take any stronger measures to attain
      that end. Neither their position, nor their private inclination, perhaps
      (and only naturally), would allow them to use any more pronounced means.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have observed before that even some of the prince&rsquo;s nearest neighbours
      had begun to oppose him. Vera Lebedeff&rsquo;s passive disagreement was limited
      to the shedding of a few solitary tears; to more frequent sitting alone at
      home, and to a diminished frequency in her visits to the prince&rsquo;s
      apartments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colia was occupied with his father at this time. The old man died during a
      second stroke, which took place just eight days after the first. The
      prince showed great sympathy in the grief of the family, and during the
      first days of their mourning he was at the house a great deal with Nina
      Alexandrovna. He went to the funeral, and it was observable that the
      public assembled in church greeted his arrival and departure with
      whisperings, and watched him closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same thing happened in the park and in the street, wherever he went.
      He was pointed out when he drove by, and he often overheard the name of
      Nastasia Philipovna coupled with his own as he passed. People looked out
      for her at the funeral, too, but she was not there; and another
      conspicuous absentee was the captain&rsquo;s widow, whom Lebedeff had prevented
      from coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      The funeral service produced a great effect on the prince. He whispered to
      Lebedeff that this was the first time he had ever heard a Russian funeral
      service since he was a little boy. Observing that he was looking about him
      uneasily, Lebedeff asked him whom he was seeking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing. I only thought I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it Rogojin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;is he here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s in church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I caught sight of his eyes!&rdquo; muttered the prince, in confusion.
      &ldquo;But what of it!&mdash;Why is he here? Was he asked?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear, no! Why, they don&rsquo;t even know him! Anyone can come in, you
      know. Why do you look so amazed? I often meet him; I&rsquo;ve seen him at least
      four times, here at Pavlofsk, within the last week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen him once&mdash;since that day!&rdquo; the prince murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Nastasia Philipovna had not said a word about having met Rogojin since
      &ldquo;that day,&rdquo; the prince concluded that the latter had his own reasons for
      wishing to keep out of sight. All the day of the funeral our hero was in a
      deeply thoughtful state, while Nastasia Philipovna was particularly merry,
      both in the daytime and in the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colia had made it up with the prince before his father&rsquo;s death, and it was
      he who urged him to make use of Keller and Burdovsky, promising to answer
      himself for the former&rsquo;s behaviour. Nina Alexandrovna and Lebedeff tried
      to persuade him to have the wedding in St. Petersburg, instead of in the
      public fashion contemplated, down here at Pavlofsk in the height of the
      season. But the prince only said that Nastasia Philipovna desired to have
      it so, though he saw well enough what prompted their arguments.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day Keller came to visit the prince. He was in a high state of
      delight with the post of honour assigned to him at the wedding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before entering he stopped on the threshold, raised his hand as if making
      a solemn vow, and cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t drink!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he went up to the prince, seized both his hands, shook them warmly,
      and declared that he had at first felt hostile towards the project of this
      marriage, and had openly said so in the billiard-rooms, but that the
      reason simply was that, with the impatience of a friend, he had hoped to
      see the prince marry at least a Princess de Rohan or de Chabot; but that
      now he saw that the prince&rsquo;s way of thinking was ten times more noble than
      that of &ldquo;all the rest put together.&rdquo; For he desired neither pomp nor
      wealth nor honour, but only the truth! The sympathies of exalted
      personages were well known, and the prince was too highly placed by his
      education, and so on, not to be in some sense an exalted personage!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But all the common herd judge differently; in the town, at the meetings,
      in the villas, at the band, in the inns and the billiard-rooms, the coming
      event has only to be mentioned and there are shouts and cries from
      everybody. I have even heard talk of getting up a &lsquo;charivari&rsquo; under the
      windows on the wedding-night. So if &lsquo;you have need of the pistol&rsquo; of an
      honest man, prince, I am ready to fire half a dozen shots even before you
      rise from your nuptial couch!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Keller also advised, in anticipation of the crowd making a rush after the
      ceremony, that a fire-hose should be placed at the entrance to the house;
      but Lebedeff was opposed to this measure, which he said might result in
      the place being pulled down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you, prince, that Lebedeff is intriguing against you. He wants
      to put you under control. Imagine that! To take &lsquo;from you the use of your
      free-will and your money&rsquo;&mdash;that is to say, the two things that
      distinguish us from the animals! I have heard it said positively. It is
      the sober truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince recollected that somebody had told him something of the kind
      before, and he had, of course, scoffed at it. He only laughed now, and
      forgot the hint at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lebedeff really had been busy for some little while; but, as usual, his
      plans had become too complex to succeed, through sheer excess of ardour.
      When he came to the prince&mdash;the very day before the wedding&mdash;to
      confess (for he always confessed to the persons against whom he intrigued,
      especially when the plan failed), he informed our hero that he himself was
      a born Talleyrand, but for some unknown reason had become simple Lebedeff.
      He then proceeded to explain his whole game to the prince, interesting the
      latter exceedingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to Lebedeff&rsquo;s account, he had first tried what he could do with
      General Epanchin. The latter informed him that he wished well to the
      unfortunate young man, and would gladly do what he could to &ldquo;save him,&rdquo;
       but that he did not think it would be seemly for him to interfere in this
      matter. Lizabetha Prokofievna would neither hear nor see him. Prince S.
      and Evgenie Pavlovitch only shrugged their shoulders, and implied that it
      was no business of theirs. However, Lebedeff had not lost heart, and went
      off to a clever lawyer,&mdash;a worthy and respectable man, whom he knew
      well. This old gentleman informed him that the thing was perfectly
      feasible if he could get hold of competent witnesses as to Muishkin&rsquo;s
      mental incapacity. Then, with the assistance of a few influential persons,
      he would soon see the matter arranged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lebedeff immediately procured the services of an old doctor, and carried
      the latter away to Pavlofsk to see the prince, by way of viewing the
      ground, as it were, and to give him (Lebedeff) counsel as to whether the
      thing was to be done or not. The visit was not to be official, but merely
      friendly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Muishkin remembered the doctor&rsquo;s visit quite well. He remembered that
      Lebedeff had said that he looked ill, and had better see a doctor; and
      although the prince scouted the idea, Lebedeff had turned up almost
      immediately with his old friend, explaining that they had just met at the
      bedside of Hippolyte, who was very ill, and that the doctor had something
      to tell the prince about the sick man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince had, of course, at once received him, and had plunged into a
      conversation about Hippolyte. He had given the doctor an account of
      Hippolyte&rsquo;s attempted suicide; and had proceeded thereafter to talk of his
      own malady,&mdash;of Switzerland, of Schneider, and so on; and so deeply
      was the old man interested by the prince&rsquo;s conversation and his
      description of Schneider&rsquo;s system, that he sat on for two hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Muishkin gave him excellent cigars to smoke, and Lebedeff, for his part,
      regaled him with liqueurs, brought in by Vera, to whom the doctor&mdash;a
      married man and the father of a family&mdash;addressed such compliments
      that she was filled with indignation. They parted friends, and, after
      leaving the prince, the doctor said to Lebedeff: &ldquo;If all such people were
      put under restraint, there would be no one left for keepers.&rdquo; Lebedeff
      then, in tragic tones, told of the approaching marriage, whereupon the
      other nodded his head and replied that, after all, marriages like that
      were not so rare; that he had heard that the lady was very fascinating and
      of extraordinary beauty, which was enough to explain the infatuation of a
      wealthy man; that, further, thanks to the liberality of Totski and of
      Rogojin, she possessed&mdash;so he had heard&mdash;not only money, but
      pearls, diamonds, shawls, and furniture, and consequently she could not be
      considered a bad match. In brief, it seemed to the doctor that the
      prince&rsquo;s choice, far from being a sign of foolishness, denoted, on the
      contrary, a shrewd, calculating, and practical mind. Lebedeff had been
      much struck by this point of view, and he terminated his confession by
      assuring the prince that he was ready, if need be, to shed his very life&rsquo;s
      blood for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hippolyte, too, was a source of some distraction to the prince at this
      time; he would send for him at any and every hour of the day. They lived,&mdash;Hippolyte
      and his mother and the children,&mdash;in a small house not far off, and
      the little ones were happy, if only because they were able to escape from
      the invalid into the garden. The prince had enough to do in keeping the
      peace between the irritable Hippolyte and his mother, and eventually the
      former became so malicious and sarcastic on the subject of the approaching
      wedding, that Muishkin took offence at last, and refused to continue his
      visits.
    </p>
    <p>
      A couple of days later, however, Hippolyte&rsquo;s mother came with tears in her
      eyes, and begged the prince to come back, &ldquo;or <i>he</i> would eat her up
      bodily.&rdquo; She added that Hippolyte had a great secret to disclose. Of
      course the prince went. There was no secret, however, unless we reckon
      certain pantings and agitated glances around (probably all put on) as the
      invalid begged his visitor to &ldquo;beware of Rogojin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is the sort of man,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;who won&rsquo;t give up his object, you
      know; he is not like you and me, prince&mdash;he belongs to quite a
      different order of beings. If he sets his heart on a thing he won&rsquo;t be
      afraid of anything&mdash;&rdquo; and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hippolyte was very ill, and looked as though he could not long survive. He
      was tearful at first, but grew more and more sarcastic and malicious as
      the interview proceeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince questioned him in detail as to his hints about Rogojin. He was
      anxious to seize upon some facts which might confirm Hippolyte&rsquo;s vague
      warnings; but there were none; only Hippolyte&rsquo;s own private impressions
      and feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the invalid&mdash;to his immense satisfaction&mdash;ended by
      seriously alarming the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first Muishkin had not cared to make any reply to his sundry questions,
      and only smiled in response to Hippolyte&rsquo;s advice to &ldquo;run for his life&mdash;abroad,
      if necessary. There are Russian priests everywhere, and one can get
      married all over the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But it was Hippolyte&rsquo;s last idea which upset him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I am really alarmed about, though,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is Aglaya Ivanovna.
      Rogojin knows how you love her. Love for love. You took Nastasia
      Philipovna from him. He will murder Aglaya Ivanovna; for though she is not
      yours, of course, now, still such an act would pain you,&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had attained his end. The prince left the house beside himself with
      terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      These warnings about Rogojin were expressed on the day before the wedding.
      That evening the prince saw Nastasia Philipovna for the last time before
      they were to meet at the altar; but Nastasia was not in a position to give
      him any comfort or consolation. On the contrary, she only added to his
      mental perturbation as the evening went on. Up to this time she had
      invariably done her best to cheer him&mdash;she was afraid of his looking
      melancholy; she would try singing to him, and telling him every sort of
      funny story or reminiscence that she could recall. The prince nearly
      always pretended to be amused, whether he were so actually or no; but
      often enough he laughed sincerely, delighted by the brilliancy of her wit
      when she was carried away by her narrative, as she very often was.
      Nastasia would be wild with joy to see the impression she had made, and to
      hear his laugh of real amusement; and she would remain the whole evening
      in a state of pride and happiness. But this evening her melancholy and
      thoughtfulness grew with every hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince had told Evgenie Pavlovitch with perfect sincerity that he
      loved Nastasia Philipovna with all his soul. In his love for her there was
      the sort of tenderness one feels for a sick, unhappy child which cannot be
      left alone. He never spoke of his feelings for Nastasia to anyone, not
      even to herself. When they were together they never discussed their
      &ldquo;feelings,&rdquo; and there was nothing in their cheerful, animated conversation
      which an outsider could not have heard. Daria Alexeyevna, with whom
      Nastasia was staying, told afterwards how she had been filled with joy and
      delight only to look at them, all this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thanks to the manner in which he regarded Nastasia&rsquo;s mental and moral
      condition, the prince was to some extent freed from other perplexities.
      She was now quite different from the woman he had known three months
      before. He was not astonished, for instance, to see her now so impatient
      to marry him&mdash;she who formerly had wept with rage and hurled curses
      and reproaches at him if he mentioned marriage! &ldquo;It shows that she no
      longer fears, as she did then, that she would make me unhappy by marrying
      me,&rdquo; he thought. And he felt sure that so sudden a change could not be a
      natural one. This rapid growth of self-confidence could not be due only to
      her hatred for Aglaya. To suppose that would be to suspect the depth of
      her feelings. Nor could it arise from dread of the fate that awaited her
      if she married Rogojin. These causes, indeed, as well as others, might
      have played a part in it, but the true reason, Muishkin decided, was the
      one he had long suspected&mdash;that the poor sick soul had come to the
      end of its forces. Yet this was an explanation that did not procure him
      any peace of mind. At times he seemed to be making violent efforts to
      think of nothing, and one would have said that he looked on his marriage
      as an unimportant formality, and on his future happiness as a thing not
      worth considering. As to conversations such as the one held with Evgenie
      Pavlovitch, he avoided them as far as possible, feeling that there were
      certain objections to which he could make no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince had observed that Nastasia knew well enough what Aglaya was to
      him. He never spoke of it, but he had seen her face when she had caught
      him starting off for the Epanchins&rsquo; house on several occasions. When the
      Epanchins left Pavlofsk, she had beamed with radiance and happiness.
      Unsuspicious and unobservant as he was, he had feared at that time that
      Nastasia might have some scheme in her mind for a scene or scandal which
      would drive Aglaya out of Pavlofsk. She had encouraged the rumours and
      excitement among the inhabitants of the place as to her marriage with the
      prince, in order to annoy her rival; and, finding it difficult to meet the
      Epanchins anywhere, she had, on one occasion, taken him for a drive past
      their house. He did not observe what was happening until they were almost
      passing the windows, when it was too late to do anything. He said nothing,
      but for two days afterwards he was ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nastasia did not try that particular experiment again. A few days before
      that fixed for the wedding, she grew grave and thoughtful. She always
      ended by getting the better of her melancholy, and becoming merry and
      cheerful again, but not quite so unaffectedly happy as she had been some
      days earlier.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince redoubled his attentive study of her symptoms. It was a most
      curious circumstance, in his opinion, that she never spoke of Rogojin. But
      once, about five days before the wedding, when the prince was at home, a
      messenger arrived begging him to come at once, as Nastasia Philipovna was
      very ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had found her in a condition approaching to absolute madness. She
      screamed, and trembled, and cried out that Rogojin was hiding out there in
      the garden&mdash;that she had seen him herself&mdash;and that he would
      murder her in the night&mdash;that he would cut her throat. She was
      terribly agitated all day. But it so happened that the prince called at
      Hippolyte&rsquo;s house later on, and heard from his mother that she had been in
      town all day, and had there received a visit from Rogojin, who had made
      inquiries about Pavlofsk. On inquiry, it turned out that Rogojin visited
      the old lady in town at almost the same moment when Nastasia declared that
      she had seen him in the garden; so that the whole thing turned out to be
      an illusion on her part. Nastasia immediately went across to Hippolyte&rsquo;s
      to inquire more accurately, and returned immensely relieved and comforted.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the day before the wedding, the prince left Nastasia in a state of
      great animation. Her wedding-dress and all sorts of finery had just
      arrived from town. Muishkin had not imagined that she would be so excited
      over it, but he praised everything, and his praise rendered her doubly
      happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Nastasia could not hide the cause of her intense interest in her
      wedding splendour. She had heard of the indignation in the town, and knew
      that some of the populace was getting up a sort of charivari with music,
      that verses had been composed for the occasion, and that the rest of
      Pavlofsk society more or less encouraged these preparations. So, since
      attempts were being made to humiliate her, she wanted to hold her head
      even higher than usual, and to overwhelm them all with the beauty and
      taste of her toilette. &ldquo;Let them shout and whistle, if they dare!&rdquo; Her
      eyes flashed at the thought. But, underneath this, she had another motive,
      of which she did not speak. She thought that possibly Aglaya, or at any
      rate someone sent by her, would be present incognito at the ceremony, or
      in the crowd, and she wished to be prepared for this eventuality.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince left her at eleven, full of these thoughts, and went home. But
      it was not twelve o&rsquo;clock when a messenger came to say that Nastasia was
      very bad, and he must come at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      On hurrying back he found his bride locked up in her own room and could
      hear her hysterical cries and sobs. It was some time before she could be
      made to hear that the prince had come, and then she opened the door only
      just sufficiently to let him in, and immediately locked it behind him. She
      then fell on her knees at his feet. (So at least Dana Alexeyevna
      reported.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What am I doing? What am I doing to you?&rdquo; she sobbed convulsively,
      embracing his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince was a whole hour soothing and comforting her, and left her, at
      length, pacified and composed. He sent another messenger during the night
      to inquire after her, and two more next morning. The last brought back a
      message that Nastasia was surrounded by a whole army of dressmakers and
      maids, and was as happy and as busy as such a beauty should be on her
      wedding morning, and that there was not a vestige of yesterday&rsquo;s agitation
      remaining. The message concluded with the news that at the moment of the
      bearer&rsquo;s departure there was a great confabulation in progress as to which
      diamonds were to be worn, and how.
    </p>
    <p>
      This message entirely calmed the prince&rsquo;s mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following report of the proceedings on the wedding day may be depended
      upon, as coming from eye-witnesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wedding was fixed for eight o&rsquo;clock in the evening. Nastasia
      Philipovna was ready at seven. From six o&rsquo;clock groups of people began to
      gather at Nastasia&rsquo;s house, at the prince&rsquo;s, and at the church door, but
      more especially at the former place. The church began to fill at seven.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colia and Vera Lebedeff were very anxious on the prince&rsquo;s account, but
      they were so busy over the arrangements for receiving the guests after the
      wedding, that they had not much time for the indulgence of personal
      feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were to be very few guests besides the best men and so on; only Dana
      Alexeyevna, the Ptitsins, Gania, and the doctor. When the prince asked
      Lebedeff why he had invited the doctor, who was almost a stranger,
      Lebedeff replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, he wears an &lsquo;order,&rsquo; and it looks so well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This idea amused the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keller and Burdovsky looked wonderfully correct in their dress-coats and
      white kid gloves, although Keller caused the bridegroom some alarm by his
      undisguisedly hostile glances at the gathering crowd of sight-seers
      outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      At about half-past seven the prince started for the church in his
      carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may remark here that he seemed anxious not to omit a single one of the
      recognized customs and traditions observed at weddings. He wished all to
      be done as openly as possible, and &ldquo;in due order.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arrived at the church, Muishkin, under Keller&rsquo;s guidance, passed through
      the crowd of spectators, amid continuous whispering and excited
      exclamations. The prince stayed near the altar, while Keller made off once
      more to fetch the bride.
    </p>
    <p>
      On reaching the gate of Daria Alexeyevna&rsquo;s house, Keller found a far
      denser crowd than he had encountered at the prince&rsquo;s. The remarks and
      exclamations of the spectators here were of so irritating a nature that
      Keller was very near making them a speech on the impropriety of their
      conduct, but was luckily caught by Burdovsky, in the act of turning to
      address them, and hurried indoors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nastasia Philipovna was ready. She rose from her seat, looked into the
      glass and remarked, as Keller told the tale afterwards, that she was &ldquo;as
      pale as a corpse.&rdquo; She then bent her head reverently, before the ikon in
      the corner, and left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      A torrent of voices greeted her appearance at the front door. The crowd
      whistled, clapped its hands, and laughed and shouted; but in a moment or
      two isolated voices were distinguishable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a beauty!&rdquo; cried one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she isn&rsquo;t the first in the world, nor the last,&rdquo; said another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marriage covers everything,&rdquo; observed a third.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I defy you to find another beauty like that,&rdquo; said a fourth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a real princess! I&rsquo;d sell my soul for such a princess as that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nastasia came out of the house looking as white as any handkerchief; but
      her large dark eyes shone upon the vulgar crowd like blazing coals. The
      spectators&rsquo; cries were redoubled, and became more exultant and triumphant
      every moment. The door of the carriage was open, and Keller had given his
      hand to the bride to help her in, when suddenly with a loud cry she rushed
      from him, straight into the surging crowd. Her friends about her were
      stupefied with amazement; the crowd parted as she rushed through it, and
      suddenly, at a distance of five or six yards from the carriage, appeared
      Rogojin. It was his look that had caught her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nastasia rushed to him like a madwoman, and seized both his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Save me!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Take me away, anywhere you like, quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rogojin seized her in his arms and almost carried her to the carriage.
      Then, in a flash, he tore a hundred-rouble note out of his pocket and held
      it to the coachman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the station, quick! If you catch the train you shall have another.
      Quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He leaped into the carriage after Nastasia and banged the door. The
      coachman did not hesitate a moment; he whipped up the horses, and they
      were off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One more second and I should have stopped him,&rdquo; said Keller, afterwards.
      In fact, he and Burdovsky jumped into another carriage and set off in
      pursuit; but it struck them as they drove along that it was not much use
      trying to bring Nastasia back by force.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; said Burdovsky, &ldquo;the prince would not like it, would he?&rdquo; So
      they gave up the pursuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rogojin and Nastasia Philipovna reached the station just in time for the
      train. As he jumped out of the carriage and was almost on the point of
      entering the train, Rogojin accosted a young girl standing on the platform
      and wearing an old-fashioned, but respectable-looking, black cloak and a
      silk handkerchief over her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take fifty roubles for your cloak?&rdquo; he shouted, holding the money out to
      the girl. Before the astonished young woman could collect her scattered
      senses, he pushed the money into her hand, seized the mantle, and threw it
      and the handkerchief over Nastasia&rsquo;s head and shoulders. The latter&rsquo;s
      wedding-array would have attracted too much attention, and it was not
      until some time later that the girl understood why her old cloak and
      kerchief had been bought at such a price.
    </p>
    <p>
      The news of what had happened reached the church with extraordinary
      rapidity. When Keller arrived, a host of people whom he did not know
      thronged around to ask him questions. There was much excited talking, and
      shaking of heads, even some laughter; but no one left the church, all
      being anxious to observe how the now celebrated bridegroom would take the
      news. He grew very pale upon hearing it, but took it quite quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was afraid,&rdquo; he muttered, scarcely audibly, &ldquo;but I hardly thought it
      would come to this.&rdquo; Then after a short silence, he added: &ldquo;However, in
      her state, it is quite consistent with the natural order of things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even Keller admitted afterwards that this was &ldquo;extraordinarily
      philosophical&rdquo; on the prince&rsquo;s part. He left the church quite calm, to all
      appearances, as many witnesses were found to declare afterwards. He seemed
      anxious to reach home and be left alone as quickly as possible; but this
      was not to be. He was accompanied by nearly all the invited guests, and
      besides this, the house was almost besieged by excited bands of people,
      who insisted upon being allowed to enter the verandah. The prince heard
      Keller and Lebedeff remonstrating and quarrelling with these unknown
      individuals, and soon went out himself. He approached the disturbers of
      his peace, requested courteously to be told what was desired; then
      politely putting Lebedeff and Keller aside, he addressed an old gentleman
      who was standing on the verandah steps at the head of the band of would-be
      guests, and courteously requested him to honour him with a visit. The old
      fellow was quite taken aback by this, but entered, followed by a few more,
      who tried to appear at their ease. The rest remained outside, and
      presently the whole crowd was censuring those who had accepted the
      invitation. The prince offered seats to his strange visitors, tea was
      served, and a general conversation sprang up. Everything was done most
      decorously, to the considerable surprise of the intruders. A few tentative
      attempts were made to turn the conversation to the events of the day, and
      a few indiscreet questions were asked; but Muishkin replied to everybody
      with such simplicity and good-humour, and at the same time with so much
      dignity, and showed such confidence in the good breeding of his guests,
      that the indiscreet talkers were quickly silenced. By degrees the
      conversation became almost serious. One gentleman suddenly exclaimed, with
      great vehemence: &ldquo;Whatever happens, I shall not sell my property; I shall
      wait. Enterprise is better than money, and there, sir, you have my whole
      system of economy, if you wish!&rdquo; He addressed the prince, who warmly
      commended his sentiments, though Lebedeff whispered in his ear that this
      gentleman, who talked so much of his &ldquo;property,&rdquo; had never had either
      house or home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearly an hour passed thus, and when tea was over the visitors seemed to
      think that it was time to go. As they went out, the doctor and the old
      gentleman bade Muishkin a warm farewell, and all the rest took their leave
      with hearty protestations of good-will, dropping remarks to the effect
      that &ldquo;it was no use worrying,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;perhaps all would turn out for
      the best,&rdquo; and so on. Some of the younger intruders would have asked for
      champagne, but they were checked by the older ones. When all had departed,
      Keller leaned over to Lebedeff, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With you and me there would have been a scene. We should have shouted and
      fought, and called in the police. But he has simply made some new friends&mdash;and
      such friends, too! I know them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lebedeff, who was slightly intoxicated, answered with a sigh:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Things are hidden from the wise and prudent, and revealed unto babes. I
      have applied those words to him before, but now I add that God has
      preserved the babe himself from the abyss, He and all His saints.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At last, about half-past ten, the prince was left alone. His head ached.
      Colia was the last to go, after having helped him to change his wedding
      clothes. They parted on affectionate terms, and, without speaking of what
      had happened, Colia promised to come very early the next day. He said
      later that the prince had given no hint of his intentions when they said
      good-bye, but had hidden them even from him. Soon there was hardly anyone
      left in the house. Burdovsky had gone to see Hippolyte; Keller and
      Lebedeff had wandered off together somewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only Vera Lebedeff remained hurriedly rearranging the furniture in the
      rooms. As she left the verandah, she glanced at the prince. He was seated
      at the table, with both elbows upon it, and his head resting on his hands.
      She approached him, and touched his shoulder gently. The prince started
      and looked at her in perplexity; he seemed to be collecting his senses for
      a minute or so, before he could remember where he was. As recollection
      dawned upon him, he became violently agitated. All he did, however, was to
      ask Vera very earnestly to knock at his door and awake him in time for the
      first train to Petersburg next morning. Vera promised, and the prince
      entreated her not to tell anyone of his intention. She promised this, too;
      and at last, when she had half-closed the door, he called her back a third
      time, took her hands in his, kissed them, then kissed her forehead, and in
      a rather peculiar manner said to her, &ldquo;Until tomorrow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such was Vera&rsquo;s story afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went away in great anxiety about him, but when she saw him in the
      morning, he seemed to be quite himself again, greeted her with a smile,
      and told her that he would very likely be back by the evening. It appears
      that he did not consider it necessary to inform anyone excepting Vera of
      his departure for town.
    </p>
    <h3>
      XI.
    </h3>
    <p>
      An hour later he was in St. Petersburg, and by ten o&rsquo;clock he had rung the
      bell at Rogojin&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had gone to the front door, and was kept waiting a long while before
      anyone came. At last the door of old Mrs. Rogojin&rsquo;s flat was opened, and
      an aged servant appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Parfen Semionovitch is not at home,&rdquo; she announced from the doorway.
      &ldquo;Whom do you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Parfen Semionovitch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is not in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old woman examined the prince from head to foot with great curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At all events tell me whether he slept at home last night, and whether he
      came alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old woman continued to stare at him, but said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was not Nastasia Philipovna here with him, yesterday evening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, pray, who are you yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prince Lef Nicolaievitch Muishkin; he knows me well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is not at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman lowered her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Nastasia Philipovna?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop a minute! When will he come back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door was shut with these words, and the old woman disappeared. The
      prince decided to come back within an hour. Passing out of the house, he
      met the porter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Parfen Semionovitch at home?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did they tell me he was not at home, then?&rdquo;
      </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did they tell you  so,&mdash;at his door?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, at his mother&rsquo;s flat; I rang at Parfen
      Semionovitch&rsquo;s door and nobody came.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he may have gone out. I can&rsquo;t tell. Sometimes he takes the keys
      with him, and leaves the rooms empty for two or three days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know for certain that he was at home last night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was Nastasia Philipovna with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; she doesn&rsquo;t come often. I think I should have known if she
      had come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince went out deep in thought, and walked up and down the pavement
      for some time. The windows of all the rooms occupied by Rogojin were
      closed, those of his mother&rsquo;s apartments were open. It was a hot, bright
      day. The prince crossed the road in order to have a good look at the
      windows again; not only were Rogojin&rsquo;s closed, but the white blinds were
      all down as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood there for a minute and then, suddenly and strangely enough, it
      seemed to him that a little corner of one of the blinds was lifted, and
      Rogojin&rsquo;s face appeared for an instant and then vanished. He waited
      another minute, and decided to go and ring the bell once more; however, he
      thought better of it again and put it off for an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chief object in his mind at this moment was to get as quickly as he
      could to Nastasia Philipovna&rsquo;s lodging. He remembered that, not long
      since, when she had left Pavlofsk at his request, he had begged her to put
      up in town at the house of a respectable widow, who had well-furnished
      rooms to let, near the Ismailofsky barracks. Probably Nastasia had kept
      the rooms when she came down to Pavlofsk this last time; and most likely
      she would have spent the night in them, Rogojin having taken her straight
      there from the station.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince took a droshky. It struck him as he drove on that he ought to
      have begun by coming here, since it was most improbable that Rogojin
      should have taken Nastasia to his own house last night. He remembered that
      the porter said she very rarely came at all, so that it was still less
      likely that she would have gone there so late at night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vainly trying to comfort himself with these reflections, the prince
      reached the Ismailofsky barracks more dead than alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      To his consternation the good people at the lodgings had not only heard
      nothing of Nastasia, but all came out to look at him as if he were a
      marvel of some sort. The whole family, of all ages, surrounded him, and he
      was begged to enter. He guessed at once that they knew perfectly well who
      he was, and that yesterday ought to have been his wedding-day; and further
      that they were dying to ask about the wedding, and especially about why he
      should be here now, inquiring for the woman who in all reasonable human
      probability might have been expected to be with him in Pavlofsk.
    </p>
    <p>
      He satisfied their curiosity, in as few words as possible, with regard to
      the wedding, but their exclamations and sighs were so numerous and sincere
      that he was obliged to tell the whole story&mdash;in a short form, of
      course. The advice of all these agitated ladies was that the prince should
      go at once and knock at Rogojin&rsquo;s until he was let in: and when let in
      insist upon a substantial explanation of everything. If Rogojin was really
      not at home, the prince was advised to go to a certain house, the address
      of which was given, where lived a German lady, a friend of Nastasia
      Philipovna&rsquo;s. It was possible that she might have spent the night there in
      her anxiety to conceal herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince rose from his seat in a condition of mental collapse. The good
      ladies reported afterwards that &ldquo;his pallor was terrible to see, and his
      legs seemed to give way underneath him.&rdquo; With difficulty he was made to
      understand that his new friends would be glad of his address, in order to
      act with him if possible. After a moment&rsquo;s thought he gave the address of
      the small hotel, on the stairs of which he had had a fit some five weeks
      since. He then set off once more for Rogojin&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time they neither opened the door at Rogojin&rsquo;s flat nor at the one
      opposite. The prince found the porter with difficulty, but when found, the
      man would hardly look at him or answer his questions, pretending to be
      busy. Eventually, however, he was persuaded to reply so far as to state
      that Rogojin had left the house early in the morning and gone to Pavlofsk,
      and that he would not return today at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall wait; he may come back this evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He may not be home for a week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, at all events, he <i>did</i> sleep here, did he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;he did sleep here, yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All this was suspicious and unsatisfactory. Very likely the porter had
      received new instructions during the interval of the prince&rsquo;s absence; his
      manner was so different now. He had been obliging&mdash;now he was as
      obstinate and silent as a mule. However, the prince decided to call again
      in a couple of hours, and after that to watch the house, in case of need.
      His hope was that he might yet find Nastasia at the address which he had
      just received. To that address he now set off at full speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But alas! at the German lady&rsquo;s house they did not even appear to
      understand what he wanted. After a while, by means of certain hints, he
      was able to gather that Nastasia must have had a quarrel with her friend
      two or three weeks ago, since which date the latter had neither heard nor
      seen anything of her. He was given to understand that the subject of
      Nastasia&rsquo;s present whereabouts was not of the slightest interest to her;
      and that Nastasia might marry all the princes in the world for all she
      cared! So Muishkin took his leave hurriedly. It struck him now that she
      might have gone away to Moscow just as she had done the last time, and
      that Rogojin had perhaps gone after her, or even <i>with</i> her. If only
      he could find some trace!
    </p>
    <p>
      However, he must take his room at the hotel; and he started off in that
      direction. Having engaged his room, he was asked by the waiter whether he
      would take dinner; replying mechanically in the affirmative, he sat down
      and waited; but it was not long before it struck him that dining would
      delay him. Enraged at this idea, he started up, crossed the dark passage
      (which filled him with horrible impressions and gloomy forebodings), and
      set out once more for Rogojin&rsquo;s. Rogojin had not returned, and no one came
      to the door. He rang at the old lady&rsquo;s door opposite, and was informed
      that Parfen Semionovitch would not return for three days. The curiosity
      with which the old servant stared at him again impressed the prince
      disagreeably. He could not find the porter this time at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      As before, he crossed the street and watched the windows from the other
      side, walking up and down in anguish of soul for half an hour or so in the
      stifling heat. Nothing stirred; the blinds were motionless; indeed, the
      prince began to think that the apparition of Rogojin&rsquo;s face could have
      been nothing but fancy. Soothed by this thought, he drove off once more to
      his friends at the Ismailofsky barracks. He was expected there. The mother
      had already been to three or four places to look for Nastasia, but had not
      found a trace of any kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince said nothing, but entered the room, sat down silently, and
      stared at them, one after the other, with the air of a man who cannot
      understand what is being said to him. It was strange&mdash;one moment he
      seemed to be so observant, the next so absent; his behaviour struck all
      the family as most remarkable. At length he rose from his seat, and begged
      to be shown Nastasia&rsquo;s rooms. The ladies reported afterwards how he had
      examined everything in the apartments. He observed an open book on the
      table, Madam Bovary, and requested the leave of the lady of the house to
      take it with him. He had turned down the leaf at the open page, and
      pocketed it before they could explain that it was a library book. He had
      then seated himself by the open window, and seeing a card-table, he asked
      who played cards.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was informed that Nastasia used to play with Rogojin every evening,
      either at &ldquo;preference&rdquo; or &ldquo;little fool,&rdquo; or &ldquo;whist&rdquo;; that this had been
      their practice since her last return from Pavlofsk; that she had taken to
      this amusement because she did not like to see Rogojin sitting silent and
      dull for whole evenings at a time; that the day after Nastasia had made a
      remark to this effect, Rogojin had whipped a pack of cards out of his
      pocket. Nastasia had laughed, but soon they began playing. The prince
      asked where were the cards, but was told that Rogojin used to bring a new
      pack every day, and always carried it away in his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good ladies recommended the prince to try knocking at Rogojin&rsquo;s once
      more&mdash;not at once, but in the evening. Meanwhile, the mother would go
      to Pavlofsk to inquire at Dana Alexeyevna&rsquo;s whether anything had been
      heard of Nastasia there. The prince was to come back at ten o&rsquo;clock and
      meet her, to hear her news and arrange plans for the morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of the kindly-meant consolations of his new friends, the prince
      walked to his hotel in inexpressible anguish of spirit, through the hot,
      dusty streets, aimlessly staring at the faces of those who passed him.
      Arrived at his destination, he determined to rest awhile in his room
      before he started for Rogojin&rsquo;s once more. He sat down, rested his elbows
      on the table and his head on his hands, and fell to thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heaven knows how long and upon what subjects he thought. He thought of
      many things&mdash;of Vera Lebedeff, and of her father; of Hippolyte; of
      Rogojin himself, first at the funeral, then as he had met him in the park,
      then, suddenly, as they had met in this very passage, outside, when
      Rogojin had watched in the darkness and awaited him with uplifted knife.
      The prince remembered his enemy&rsquo;s eyes as they had glared at him in the
      darkness. He shuddered, as a sudden idea struck him.
    </p>
    <p>
      This idea was, that if Rogojin were in Petersburg, though he might hide
      for a time, yet he was quite sure to come to him&mdash;the prince&mdash;before
      long, with either good or evil intentions, but probably with the same
      intention as on that other occasion. At all events, if Rogojin were to
      come at all he would be sure to seek the prince here&mdash;he had no other
      town address&mdash;perhaps in this same corridor; he might well seek him
      here if he needed him. And perhaps he did need him. This idea seemed quite
      natural to the prince, though he could not have explained why he should so
      suddenly have become necessary to Rogojin. Rogojin would not come if all
      were well with him, that was part of the thought; he would come if all
      were not well; and certainly, undoubtedly, all would not be well with him.
      The prince could not bear this new idea; he took his hat and rushed out
      towards the street. It was almost dark in the passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What if he were to come out of that corner as I go by and&mdash;and stop
      me?&rdquo; thought the prince, as he approached the familiar spot. But no one
      came out.
    </p>
    <p>
      He passed under the gateway and into the street. The crowds of people
      walking about&mdash;as is always the case at sunset in Petersburg, during
      the summer&mdash;surprised him, but he walked on in the direction of
      Rogojin&rsquo;s house.
    </p>
    <p>
      About fifty yards from the hotel, at the first cross-road, as he passed
      through the crowd of foot-passengers sauntering along, someone touched his
      shoulder, and said in a whisper into his ear:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lef Nicolaievitch, my friend, come along with me.&rdquo; It was Rogojin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince immediately began to tell him, eagerly and joyfully, how he had
      but the moment before expected to see him in the dark passage of the
      hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was there,&rdquo; said Rogojin, unexpectedly. &ldquo;Come along.&rdquo; The prince was
      surprised at this answer; but his astonishment increased a couple of
      minutes afterwards, when he began to consider it. Having thought it over,
      he glanced at Rogojin in alarm. The latter was striding along a yard or so
      ahead, looking straight in front of him, and mechanically making way for
      anyone he met.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you not ask for me at my room if you were in the hotel?&rdquo; asked
      the prince, suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rogojin stopped and looked at him; then reflected, and replied as though
      he had not heard the question:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Lef Nicolaievitch, you go straight on to the house; I shall
      walk on the other side. See that we keep together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Rogojin crossed the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived on the opposite pavement, he looked back to see whether the prince
      were moving, waved his hand in the direction of the Gorohovaya, and strode
      on, looking across every moment to see whether Muishkin understood his
      instructions. The prince supposed that Rogojin desired to look out for
      someone whom he was afraid to miss; but if so, why had he not told <i>him</i>
      whom to look out for? So the two proceeded for half a mile or so. Suddenly
      the prince began to tremble from some unknown cause. He could not bear it,
      and signalled to Rogojin across the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter came at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Nastasia Philipovna at your house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And was it you looked out of the window under the blind this morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why did&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the prince could not finish his question; he did not know what to say.
      Besides this, his heart was beating so that he found it difficult to speak
      at all. Rogojin was silent also and looked at him as before, with an
      expression of deep thoughtfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m going,&rdquo; he said, at last, preparing to recross the road. &ldquo;You
      go along here as before; we will keep to different sides of the road; it&rsquo;s
      better so, you&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When they reached the Gorohovaya, and came near the house, the prince&rsquo;s
      legs were trembling so that he could hardly walk. It was about ten
      o&rsquo;clock. The old lady&rsquo;s windows were open, as before; Rogojin&rsquo;s were all
      shut, and in the darkness the white blinds showed whiter than ever.
      Rogojin and the prince each approached the house on his respective side of
      the road; Rogojin, who was on the near side, beckoned the prince across.
      He went over to the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even the porter does not know that I have come home now. I told him, and
      told them at my mother&rsquo;s too, that I was off to Pavlofsk,&rdquo; said Rogojin,
      with a cunning and almost satisfied smile. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go in quietly and nobody
      will hear us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had the key in his hand. Mounting the staircase he turned and signalled
      to the prince to go more softly; he opened the door very quietly, let the
      prince in, followed him, locked the door behind him, and put the key in
      his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along,&rdquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had spoken in a whisper all the way. In spite of his apparent outward
      composure, he was evidently in a state of great mental agitation. Arrived
      in a large salon, next to the study, he went to the window and cautiously
      beckoned the prince up to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you rang the bell this morning I thought it must be you. I went to
      the door on tip-toe and heard you talking to the servant opposite. I had
      told her before that if anyone came and rang&mdash;especially you, and I
      gave her your name&mdash;she was not to tell about me. Then I thought,
      what if he goes and stands opposite and looks up, or waits about to watch
      the house? So I came to this very window, looked out, and there you were
      staring straight at me. That&rsquo;s how it came about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Nastasia Philipovna?&rdquo; asked the prince, breathlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s here,&rdquo; replied Rogojin, slowly, after a slight pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rogojin raised his eyes and gazed intently at the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He continued to speak in a whisper, very deliberately as before, and
      looked strangely thoughtful and dreamy. Even while he told the story of
      how he had peeped through the blind, he gave the impression of wishing to
      say something else. They entered the study. In this room some changes had
      taken place since the prince last saw it. It was now divided into two
      equal parts by a heavy green silk curtain stretched across it, separating
      the alcove beyond, where stood Rogojin&rsquo;s bed, from the rest of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The heavy curtain was drawn now, and it was very dark. The bright
      Petersburg summer nights were already beginning to close in, and but for
      the full moon, it would have been difficult to distinguish anything in
      Rogojin&rsquo;s dismal room, with the drawn blinds. They could just see one
      anothers faces, however, though not in detail. Rogojin&rsquo;s face was white,
      as usual. His glittering eyes watched the prince with an intent stare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had you not better light a candle?&rdquo; said Muishkin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I needn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied Rogojin, and taking the other by the hand he drew
      him down to a chair. He himself took a chair opposite and drew it up so
      close that he almost pressed against the prince&rsquo;s knees. At their side was
      a little round table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; said Rogojin; &ldquo;let&rsquo;s rest a bit.&rdquo; There was silence for a
      moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew you would be at that hotel,&rdquo; he continued, just as men sometimes
      commence a serious conversation by discussing any outside subject before
      leading up to the main point. &ldquo;As I entered the passage it struck me that
      perhaps you were sitting and waiting for me, just as I was waiting for
      you. Have you been to the old lady at Ismailofsky barracks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the prince, squeezing the word out with difficulty owing to
      the dreadful beating of his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you would. &lsquo;They&rsquo;ll talk about it,&rsquo; I thought; so I determined
      to go and fetch you to spend the night here&mdash;&lsquo;We will be together,&rsquo; I
      thought, &lsquo;for this one night&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rogojin, <i>where</i> is Nastasia Philipovna?&rdquo; said the prince, suddenly
      rising from his seat. He was quaking in all his limbs, and his words came
      in a scarcely audible whisper. Rogojin rose also.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; he whispered, nodding his head towards the curtain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Asleep?&rdquo; whispered the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rogojin looked intently at him again, as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go in&mdash;but you mustn&rsquo;t&mdash;well&mdash;let&rsquo;s go in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He lifted the curtain, paused&mdash;and turned to the prince. &ldquo;Go in,&rdquo; he
      said, motioning him to pass behind the curtain. Muishkin went in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so dark,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can see quite enough,&rdquo; muttered Rogojin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can just see there&rsquo;s a bed&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go nearer,&rdquo; suggested Rogojin, softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince took a step forward&mdash;then another&mdash;and paused. He
      stood and stared for a minute or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither of the men spoke a word while at the bedside. The prince&rsquo;s heart
      beat so loud that its knocking seemed to be distinctly audible in the
      deathly silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now his eyes had become so far accustomed to the darkness that he
      could distinguish the whole of the bed. Someone was asleep upon it&mdash;in
      an absolutely motionless sleep. Not the slightest movement was
      perceptible, not the faintest breathing could be heard. The sleeper was
      covered with a white sheet; the outline of the limbs was hardly
      distinguishable. He could only just make out that a human being lay
      outstretched there.
    </p>
    <p>
      All around, on the bed, on a chair beside it, on the floor, were scattered
      the different portions of a magnificent white silk dress, bits of lace,
      ribbons and flowers. On a small table at the bedside glittered a mass of
      diamonds, torn off and thrown down anyhow. From under a heap of lace at
      the end of the bed peeped a small white foot, which looked as though it
      had been chiselled out of marble; it was terribly still.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince gazed and gazed, and felt that the more he gazed the more
      death-like became the silence. Suddenly a fly awoke somewhere, buzzed
      across the room, and settled on the pillow. The prince shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; said Rogojin, touching his shoulder. They left the alcove and
      sat down in the two chairs they had occupied before, opposite to one
      another. The prince trembled more and more violently, and never took his
      questioning eyes off Rogojin&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see you are shuddering, Lef Nicolaievitch,&rdquo; said the latter, at length,
      &ldquo;almost as you did once in Moscow, before your fit; don&rsquo;t you remember? I
      don&rsquo;t know what I shall do with you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince bent forward to listen, putting all the strain he could muster
      upon his understanding in order to take in what Rogojin said, and
      continuing to gaze at the latter&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it you?&rdquo; he muttered, at last, motioning with his head towards the
      curtain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it was I,&rdquo; whispered Rogojin, looking down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither spoke for five minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because, you know,&rdquo; Rogojin recommenced, as though continuing a former
      sentence, &ldquo;if you were ill now, or had a fit, or screamed, or anything,
      they might hear it in the yard, or even in the street, and guess that
      someone was passing the night in the house. They would all come and knock
      and want to come in, because they know I am not at home. I didn&rsquo;t light a
      candle for the same reason. When I am not here&mdash;for two or three days
      at a time, now and then&mdash;no one comes in to tidy the house or
      anything; those are my orders. So that I want them to not know we are
      spending the night here&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; interrupted the prince. &ldquo;I asked both the porter and the woman
      whether Nastasia Philipovna had spent last night in the house; so they
      knew&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you asked. I told them that she had called in for ten minutes, and
      then gone straight back to Pavlofsk. No one knows she slept here. Last
      night we came in just as carefully as you and I did today. I thought as I
      came along with her that she would not like to creep in so secretly, but I
      was quite wrong. She whispered, and walked on tip-toe; she carried her
      skirt over her arm, so that it shouldn&rsquo;t rustle, and she held up her
      finger at me on the stairs, so that I shouldn&rsquo;t make a noise&mdash;it was
      you she was afraid of. She was mad with terror in the train, and she
      begged me to bring her to this house. I thought of taking her to her rooms
      at the Ismailofsky barracks first; but she wouldn&rsquo;t hear of it. She said,
      &lsquo;No&mdash;not there; he&rsquo;ll find me out at once there. Take me to your own
      house, where you can hide me, and tomorrow we&rsquo;ll set off for Moscow.&rsquo;
      Thence she would go to Orel, she said. When she went to bed, she was still
      talking about going to Orel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait! What do you intend to do now, Parfen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m afraid of you. You shudder and tremble so. We&rsquo;ll pass the night
      here together. There are no other beds besides that one; but I&rsquo;ve thought
      how we&rsquo;ll manage. I&rsquo;ll take the cushions off all the sofas, and lay them
      down on the floor, up against the curtain here&mdash;for you and me&mdash;so
      that we shall be together. For if they come in and look about now, you
      know, they&rsquo;ll find her, and carry her away, and they&rsquo;ll be asking me
      questions, and I shall say I did it, and then they&rsquo;ll take me away, too,
      don&rsquo;t you see? So let her lie close to us&mdash;close to you and me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; agreed the prince, warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So we will not say anything about it, or let them take her away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for anything!&rdquo; cried the other; &ldquo;no, no, no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I had decided, my friend; not to give her up to anyone,&rdquo; continued
      Rogojin. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be very quiet. I have only been out of the house one hour
      all day, all the rest of the time I have been with her. I dare say the air
      is very bad here. It is so hot. Do you find it bad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;perhaps&mdash;by morning it will be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve covered her with oilcloth&mdash;best American oilcloth, and put the
      sheet over that, and four jars of disinfectant, on account of the smell&mdash;as
      they did at Moscow&mdash;you remember? And she&rsquo;s lying so still; you shall
      see, in the morning, when it&rsquo;s light. What! can&rsquo;t you get up?&rdquo; asked
      Rogojin, seeing the other was trembling so that he could not rise from his
      seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My legs won&rsquo;t move,&rdquo; said the prince; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s fear, I know. When my fear is
      over, I&rsquo;ll get up&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a bit&mdash;I&rsquo;ll make the bed, and you can lie down. I&rsquo;ll lie down,
      too, and we&rsquo;ll listen and watch, for I don&rsquo;t know yet what I shall do... I
      tell you beforehand, so that you may be ready in case I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Muttering these disconnected words, Rogojin began to make up the beds. It
      was clear that he had devised these beds long before; last night he slept
      on the sofa. But there was no room for two on the sofa, and he seemed
      anxious that he and the prince should be close to one another; therefore,
      he now dragged cushions of all sizes and shapes from the sofas, and made a
      sort of bed of them close by the curtain. He then approached the prince,
      and gently helped him to rise, and led him towards the bed. But the prince
      could now walk by himself, so that his fear must have passed; for all
      that, however, he continued to shudder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hot weather, you see,&rdquo; continued Rogojin, as he lay down on the
      cushions beside Muishkin, &ldquo;and, naturally, there will be a smell. I
      daren&rsquo;t open the window. My mother has some beautiful flowers in pots;
      they have a delicious scent; I thought of fetching them in, but that old
      servant will find out, she&rsquo;s very inquisitive.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she is inquisitive,&rdquo; assented the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought of buying flowers, and putting them all round her; but I was
      afraid it would make us sad to see her with flowers round her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said the prince; he was bewildered, and his brain wandered.
      He seemed to be continually groping for the questions he wished to ask,
      and then losing them. &ldquo;Listen&mdash;tell me&mdash;how did you&mdash;with a
      knife?&mdash;That same one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that same one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a minute, I want to ask you something else, Parfen; all sorts of
      things; but tell me first, did you intend to kill her before my wedding,
      at the church door, with your knife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether I did or not,&rdquo; said Rogojin, drily, seeming to be a
      little astonished at the question, and not quite taking it in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you never take your knife to Pavlofsk with you?&rdquo;
      </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. As to the
      knife,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;this is all I can tell you about it.&rdquo; He was silent for
      a moment, and then said, &ldquo;I took it out of the locked drawer this morning
      about three, for it was in the early morning all this&mdash;happened. It
      has been inside the book ever since&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;this is what
      is such a marvel to me, the knife only went in a couple of inches at most,
      just under her left breast, and there wasn&rsquo;t more than half a
      tablespoonful of blood altogether, not more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;yes&mdash;&rdquo; The prince jumped up in extraordinary
      agitation. &ldquo;I know, I know, I&rsquo;ve read of that sort of thing&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      internal haemorrhage, you know. Sometimes there isn&rsquo;t a drop&mdash;if the
      blow goes straight to the heart&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait&mdash;listen!&rdquo; cried Rogojin, suddenly, starting up. &ldquo;Somebody&rsquo;s
      walking about, do you hear? In the hall.&rdquo; Both sat up to listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear,&rdquo; said the prince in a whisper, his eyes fixed on Rogojin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Footsteps?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we shut the door, and lock it, or not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, lock it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They locked the door, and both lay down again. There was a long silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, by-the-by,&rdquo; whispered the prince, hurriedly and excitedly as before,
      as though he had just seized hold of an idea and was afraid of losing it
      again. &ldquo;I&mdash;I wanted those cards! They say you played cards with her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I played with her,&rdquo; said Rogojin, after a short silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are the cards?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here they are,&rdquo; said Rogojin, after a still longer pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pulled out a pack of cards, wrapped in a bit of paper, from his pocket,
      and handed them to the prince. The latter took them, with a sort of
      perplexity. A new, sad, helpless feeling weighed on his heart; he had
      suddenly realized that not only at this moment, but for a long while, he
      had not been saying what he wanted to say, had not been acting as he
      wanted to act; and that these cards which he held in his hand, and which
      he had been so delighted to have at first, were now of no use&mdash;no
      use... He rose, and wrung his hands. Rogojin lay motionless, and seemed
      neither to hear nor see his movements; but his eyes blazed in the
      darkness, and were fixed in a wild stare.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince sat down on a chair, and watched him in alarm. Half an hour
      went by.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Rogojin burst into a loud abrupt laugh, as though he had quite
      forgotten that they must speak in whispers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That officer, eh!&mdash;that young officer&mdash;don&rsquo;t you remember that
      fellow at the band? Eh? Ha, ha, ha! Didn&rsquo;t she whip him smartly, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince jumped up from his seat in renewed terror. When Rogojin quieted
      down (which he did at once) the prince bent over him, sat down beside him,
      and with painfully beating heart and still more painful breath, watched
      his face intently. Rogojin never turned his head, and seemed to have
      forgotten all about him. The prince watched and waited. Time went on&mdash;it
      began to grow light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rogojin began to wander&mdash;muttering disconnectedly; then he took to
      shouting and laughing. The prince stretched out a trembling hand and
      gently stroked his hair and his cheeks&mdash;he could do nothing more. His
      legs trembled again and he seemed to have lost the use of them. A new
      sensation came over him, filling his heart and soul with infinite anguish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the daylight grew full and strong; and at last the prince lay
      down, as though overcome by despair, and laid his face against the white,
      motionless face of Rogojin. His tears flowed on to Rogojin&rsquo;s cheek, though
      he was perhaps not aware of them himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      At all events when, after many hours, the door was opened and people
      thronged in, they found the murderer unconscious and in a raging fever.
      The prince was sitting by him, motionless, and each time that the sick man
      gave a laugh, or a shout, he hastened to pass his own trembling hand over
      his companion&rsquo;s hair and cheeks, as though trying to soothe and quiet him.
      But alas! he understood nothing of what was said to him, and recognized
      none of those who surrounded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Schneider himself had arrived then and seen his former pupil and
      patient, remembering the prince&rsquo;s condition during the first year in
      Switzerland, he would have flung up his hands, despairingly, and cried, as
      he did then:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An idiot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <h3>
      XII.
    </h3>
    <p>
      When the widow hurried away to Pavlofsk, she went straight to Daria
      Alexeyevna&rsquo;s house, and telling all she knew, threw her into a state of
      great alarm. Both ladies decided to communicate at once with Lebedeff,
      who, as the friend and landlord of the prince, was also much agitated.
      Vera Lebedeff told all she knew, and by Lebedeff&rsquo;s advice it was decided
      that all three should go to Petersburg as quickly as possible, in order to
      avert &ldquo;what might so easily happen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This is how it came about that at eleven o&rsquo;clock next morning Rogojin&rsquo;s
      flat was opened by the police in the presence of Lebedeff, the two ladies,
      and Rogojin&rsquo;s own brother, who lived in the wing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evidence of the porter went further than anything else towards the
      success of Lebedeff in gaining the assistance of the police. He declared
      that he had seen Rogojin return to the house last night, accompanied by a
      friend, and that both had gone upstairs very secretly and cautiously.
      After this there was no hesitation about breaking open the door, since it
      could not be got open in any other way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rogojin suffered from brain fever for two months. When he recovered from
      the attack he was at once brought up on trial for murder.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave full, satisfactory, and direct evidence on every point; and the
      prince&rsquo;s name was, thanks to this, not brought into the proceedings.
      Rogojin was very quiet during the progress of the trial. He did not
      contradict his clever and eloquent counsel, who argued that the brain
      fever, or inflammation of the brain, was the cause of the crime; clearly
      proving that this malady had existed long before the murder was
      perpetrated, and had been brought on by the sufferings of the accused.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Rogojin added no words of his own in confirmation of this view, and as
      before, he recounted with marvellous exactness the details of his crime.
      He was convicted, but with extenuating circumstances, and condemned to
      hard labour in Siberia for fifteen years. He heard his sentence grimly,
      silently, and thoughtfully. His colossal fortune, with the exception of
      the comparatively small portion wasted in the first wanton period of his
      inheritance, went to his brother, to the great satisfaction of the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old lady, Rogojin&rsquo;s mother, is still alive, and remembers her
      favourite son Parfen sometimes, but not clearly. God spared her the
      knowledge of this dreadful calamity which had overtaken her house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lebedeff, Keller, Gania, Ptitsin, and many other friends of ours continue
      to live as before. There is scarcely any change in them, so that there is
      no need to tell of their subsequent doings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hippolyte died in great agitation, and rather sooner than he expected,
      about a fortnight after Nastasia Philipovna&rsquo;s death. Colia was much
      affected by these events, and drew nearer to his mother in heart and
      sympathy. Nina Alexandrovna is anxious, because he is &ldquo;thoughtful beyond
      his years,&rdquo; but he will, we think, make a useful and active man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince&rsquo;s further fate was more or less decided by Colia, who selected,
      out of all the persons he had met during the last six or seven months,
      Evgenie Pavlovitch, as friend and confidant. To him he made over all that
      he knew as to the events above recorded, and as to the present condition
      of the prince. He was not far wrong in his choice. Evgenie Pavlovitch took
      the deepest interest in the fate of the unfortunate &ldquo;idiot,&rdquo; and, thanks
      to his influence, the prince found himself once more with Dr. Schneider,
      in Switzerland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evgenie Pavlovitch, who went abroad at this time, intending to live a long
      while on the continent, being, as he often said, quite superfluous in
      Russia, visits his sick friend at Schneider&rsquo;s every few months.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Dr. Schneider frowns ever more and more and shakes his head; he hints
      that the brain is fatally injured; he does not as yet declare that his
      patient is incurable, but he allows himself to express the gravest fears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evgenie takes this much to heart, and he has a heart, as is proved by the
      fact that he receives and even answers letters from Colia. But besides
      this, another trait in his character has become apparent, and as it is a
      good trait we will make haste to reveal it. After each visit to
      Schneider&rsquo;s establishment, Evgenie Pavlovitch writes another letter,
      besides that to Colia, giving the most minute particulars concerning the
      invalid&rsquo;s condition. In these letters is to be detected, and in each one
      more than the last, a growing feeling of friendship and sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The individual who corresponds thus with Evgenie Pavlovitch, and who
      engages so much of his attention and respect, is Vera Lebedeff. We have
      never been able to discover clearly how such relations sprang up. Of
      course the root of them was in the events which we have already recorded,
      and which so filled Vera with grief on the prince&rsquo;s account that she fell
      seriously ill. But exactly how the acquaintance and friendship came about,
      we cannot say.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have spoken of these letters chiefly because in them is often to be
      found some news of the Epanchin family, and of Aglaya in particular.
      Evgenie Pavlovitch wrote of her from Paris, that after a short and sudden
      attachment to a certain Polish count, an exile, she had suddenly married
      him, quite against the wishes of her parents, though they had eventually
      given their consent through fear of a terrible scandal. Then, after a six
      months&rsquo; silence, Evgenie Pavlovitch informed his correspondent, in a long
      letter, full of detail, that while paying his last visit to Dr.
      Schneider&rsquo;s establishment, he had there come across the whole Epanchin
      family (excepting the general, who had remained in St. Petersburg) and
      Prince S. The meeting was a strange one. They all received Evgenie
      Pavlovitch with effusive delight; Adelaida and Alexandra were deeply
      grateful to him for his &ldquo;angelic kindness to the unhappy prince.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lizabetha Prokofievna, when she saw poor Muishkin, in his enfeebled and
      humiliated condition, had wept bitterly. Apparently all was forgiven him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prince S. had made a few just and sensible remarks. It seemed to Evgenie
      Pavlovitch that there was not yet perfect harmony between Adelaida and her
      fiance, but he thought that in time the impulsive young girl would let
      herself be guided by his reason and experience. Besides, the recent events
      that had befallen her family had given Adelaida much to think about,
      especially the sad experiences of her younger sister. Within six months,
      everything that the family had dreaded from the marriage with the Polish
      count had come to pass. He turned out to be neither count nor exile&mdash;at
      least, in the political sense of the word&mdash;but had had to leave his
      native land owing to some rather dubious affair of the past. It was his
      noble patriotism, of which he made a great display, that had rendered him
      so interesting in Aglaya&rsquo;s eyes. She was so fascinated that, even before
      marrying him, she joined a committee that had been organized abroad to
      work for the restoration of Poland; and further, she visited the
      confessional of a celebrated Jesuit priest, who made an absolute fanatic
      of her. The supposed fortune of the count had dwindled to a mere nothing,
      although he had given almost irrefutable evidence of its existence to
      Lizabetha Prokofievna and Prince S.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides this, before they had been married half a year, the count and his
      friend the priest managed to bring about a quarrel between Aglaya and her
      family, so that it was now several months since they had seen her. In a
      word, there was a great deal to say; but Mrs. Epanchin, and her daughters,
      and even Prince S., were still so much distressed by Aglaya&rsquo;s latest
      infatuations and adventures, that they did not care to talk of them,
      though they must have known that Evgenie knew much of the story already.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Lizabetha Prokofievna was most anxious to get home, and, according to
      Evgenie&rsquo;s account, she criticized everything foreign with much hostility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They can&rsquo;t bake bread anywhere, decently; and they all freeze in their
      houses, during winter, like a lot of mice in a cellar. At all events, I&rsquo;ve
      had a good Russian cry over this poor fellow,&rdquo; she added, pointing to the
      prince, who had not recognized her in the slightest degree. &ldquo;So enough of
      this nonsense; it&rsquo;s time we faced the truth. All this continental life,
      all this Europe of yours, and all the trash about &lsquo;going abroad&rsquo; is simply
      foolery, and it is mere foolery on our part to come. Remember what I say,
      my friend; you&rsquo;ll live to agree with me yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So spoke the good lady, almost angrily, as she took leave of Evgenie
      Pavlovitch.
    </p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
